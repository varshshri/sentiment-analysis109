       "'\\x0c\\x0c\\x0cWINGS OF FIRE\\n\\nAn Autobiography\\n\\nAVUL PAKIR JAINULABDEEN ABDUL KALAM  has\\ncome to personally represent to many of his countrymen the\\nbest aspects of Indian life. Born in 1931, the son of a little\\neducated  boatowner  in  Rameswaram,  Tamilnadu,  he  had\\nan unparalleled career as a defence scientist, culminating\\nin the highest civilian award of India, the Bharat Ratna.\\n\\nAs  chief  of \\n\\nthe  country’s  defence  research  and\\ndevelopment  programme,  Kalam  demonstrated  the  great\\npotential  for  dynamism  and  innovation  that  existed  in\\nseemingly  moribund  research  establishments.  This  is  the\\nstory of Kalam’s rise from obscurity and his personal and\\nprofessional struggles, as well as the story of Agni, Prithvi,\\nAkash,  Trishul a nd Nag  - missiles  that  have  become\\nhousehold names in India and that have raised the nation to\\nthe level of a missile power of international recokoning.\\n\\nAt  the  same  time  as  he  has  helped  create  India’s\\nawesome  weaponry,  Kalam  has  maintained  the  ascetic\\nrigour  of  his  personal  life,  working  18  hours  a  day  and\\npracticing  the  veena.  With  characteristic  modesty,  Kalam\\nascribes the greatness of his achievement to the influence\\nof his teachers and mentors. He describes the struggles of\\nhis  boyhood  and  youth,  bringing  alive  everyday  life  in  a\\nsmall  town  in  South  India  and  the  inspirational  role  of\\neducators.  He  describes  the  role  of  visionary  Indian\\nscientists, such as Dr Vikram Sarabhai, and of the creation\\nof  a  coordinated  network  of  research  institutions.  This  is\\nalso \\nfor\\nindependent \\ntechnological self sufficiency and defensive autonomy – a\\nstory as much about politics, domestic and international, as\\nit is about science.\\n\\nIndia’s  struggle \\n\\nthe  saga  of \\n\\nArun  Tiwari  worked  under  Dr  APJ  Abdul  Kalam  for\\nover a decade in the Defence Research and Development\\nLaboratory  (DRDL),  Hyderabad.

This  might  seem \\nto  disqualify  me  as  his\\nbiographer, and I certainly had no notion of being one. One\\nday, while speaking to him, I\\n\\nasked him if he had a message for young Indians. His\\nmessage fascinated me. Later, I mustered the courage to\\nask  him  about  his  recollections  so  that  I  could  pen  them\\ndown before they were buried irretrievably under the sands\\nof time.\\n\\nWe had a long series of sittings late into the night and\\nearly under the fading stars of dawn—all somehow stolen\\nfrom his very busy schedule of eighteen hours a day. The\\nprofundity and range of his ideas mesmerized me. He had\\ntremendous  vitality  and  obviously  received \\nimmense\\npleasure from the world of ideas. His conversation was not\\nalways easy to follow, but was always fresh and stimulating.\\nThere  were  complexities,  subtleties,  and \\nintriguing\\nmetaphors  and  subplots  in  his  narrative,  but  gradually  the\\nunfolding of his brilliant mind took the form of a continuous\\ndiscourse.\\n\\nWhen I sat down to write this book, I felt that it required\\ngreater  skills \\nthe\\nimportance of this task and regarding it an honour to have\\nbeen  permitted  to  attempt  it,  I  prayed  earnestly  for  the\\ncourage and calibre to complete it.\\n\\nI  possessed.  But \\n\\nrealising \\n\\nthan \\n\\nThis book is written for the ordinary people of India for\\nwhom Dr Kalam has an immense affection, and of whom\\nDr Kalam is certainly one. He has an intuitive rapport with\\nthe humblest and simplest people, an indication of his own\\nsimplicity and innate spirituality.\\n\\nFor myself, writing this book has been like a pilgrimage.\\nThrough  Dr  Kalam,  I  was  blessed  with  the  revelation  that\\nthe real joy of living can be found in only one way—in one’s\\ncommunion  with  an  eternal  source  of  hidden  knowledge\\nwithin oneself—which each individual is bidden to seek and\\nfind for himself or herself. Many of you may never meet Dr\\nKalam  in  person,  but  I  hope  you  will  enjoy  his  company\\nthrough  this  book,  and  that  he  will  become  your  spiritual\\nfriend.\\n\\nI could include in this book only a few incidents among\\nthe  many  narrated  to  me  by  Dr  Kalam.  In  fact,  this  book\\n\\n\\x0cprovides  only  a  thumbnail  sketch  of  Dr  Kalam’s  life.  It  is\\nquite  possible  that  certain  important  incidents  have  been\\ninadvertently  dropped  and  that  the  contribution  of  some\\nindividuals  to  the  projects  co-ordinated  by  Dr  Kalam  has\\ngone  unrecorded.  Since  a  quarter-century  of  professional\\nlife  separates  me  from  Dr  Kalam,  some  important  issues\\nmight  also  have  remained  unrecorded  or  have  been\\ndistorted.  I  am  solely  responsible  for  such  shortcomings,\\nwhich are, of course, completely unintentional.\\nArun Tiwari\\nAcknowledgements Introduction\\nI\\n\\nwish to express my gratitude to all the people involved\\nin  the  writing  of  this  book,  especially  Mr  YS  Rajan,  Mr A\\nSivathanu  Pillai,  Mr  RN Agarwal,  Mr  Prahlada,  Mr  KVSS\\nPrasada Rao\\nand Dr SK Salwan, who were very generous in sharing their\\ntime and knowledge with me.\\n\\nI  am  thankful  to  Prof.  KAV  Pandalai  and  Mr  R\\nSwaminathan,  for  critical  reviews  of  the  text.  I  thank  Dr  B\\nSoma Raju for his tangible, but always unspoken support,\\nfor  this  project.  My  sincere  thanks  go  to  my  wife  and\\nunsparing critic, Dr Anjana Tiwari, for her tough comments,\\naccompanied with her gentle support.\\nIt has been a pleasure to work with Universities Press, and\\nthe cooperation of the editorial and production staff is much\\nappreciated.\\n\\nThere are many fine people, such as the photographer\\nMr. Prabhu, who have selflessly enriched me and this book\\nin ways beyond measure. I thank them all.\\n\\nAnd  finally,  my  deepest  gratitude  to  my  sons, Aseem\\nand Amol— for their unfailing emotional support during the\\nwriting,  and  because  I  seek  in  them  that  attitude  towards\\nlife  which  Dr  Kalam  admired,  and  wanted  this  work  to\\nreflect.\\nArun Tiwari\\n\\nThis  book  is  being  released  at  a  time  when  India’s\\ntechnological  endeavours,  to  assert  its  sovereignty  and\\nstrengthen its security, are questioned by many in the world.\\nHistorically, people have always fought among themselves\\non one issue or another. Prehistorically, battles were fought\\nover food and shelter. With the passage of time, wars were\\nwaged over religious and ideological beliefs; and now the\\ndominant struggle of sophisticated warfare is for economic\\nand  technological  supremacy.  Consequently,  economic\\nand  technological  supremacy  is  equated  with  political\\npower and world control.\\n\\nvery \\n\\nAfew  nations  who  have  grown \\n\\nstrong\\ntechnologically, over the past few centuries, have wrested\\ncontrol, for their own purposes. These major powers have\\nbecome  the  self-proclaimed  leaders  of  the  new  world\\norder. What does a country of one billion people, like India,\\ndo in such a situation? We have no other option but to be\\ntechnologically strong. But, can India be a leader in the field\\nof technology? My answer is an emphatic ‘Yes’. And let me\\nvalidate  my  answer  by  narrating  some  incidents  from  my\\nlife.\\n\\nWhen  I  first  began  the  reminiscences  that  have  gone\\ninto this book, I was uncertain about which of my memories\\nwere  worth  narrating  or  were  of  any  relevance  at  all.  My\\nchildhood is precious to me, but would it be of interest to\\nanyone else? Was it worth the reader’s while, I wondered,\\nto know about the tribulations and triumphs of a smalltown\\nboy? Of the straitened circumstances of my schooldays, the\\nodd jobs I did to pay my school fees, and how my decision\\nto  become  a  vegetarian  was  partly  due  to  my  financial\\n\\n\\x0cto  become  a  vegetarian  was  partly  due  to  my  financial\\nconstraints  as  a  college  student—why  should  these  be  of\\nany  interest  to  the  general  public?  In  the  end,  I  was\\nconvinced that these were relevant, if not for anything else\\nbut  because  they  tell  something  of  the  story  of  modern\\nIndia, as individual destiny and the social matrix in which it\\nis  embedded  cannot  be  seen  in  isolation.  Having  been\\npersuaded  of  this,  it  did  seem  germane  to  include  the\\naccounts of my frustrated attempt to become an Air Force\\npilot  and  of  how  I  became,  instead  of  the  Collector  my\\nfather dreamed I would be, a rocket engineer.\\n\\nFinally, I decided to describe the individuals who had a\\nprofound influence on my life. This book is also by way of a\\nsubmission  of  thanks,  therefore,  to  my  parents  and\\nimmediate family, and to the teachers and preceptors I was\\nfortunate  to  have  had,  both  as  a  student  and  in  my\\nprofessional  life.  It  is  also  a  tribute  to  the  unflagging\\nenthusiasm and efforts of my young colleagues who helped\\nto realise our collective dreams. The famous words of Isaac\\nNewton about standing on the shoulders of giants are valid\\nfor  every  scientist  and  I  certainly  owe  a  great  debt  of\\nknowledge  and  inspiration  to  the  distinguished  lineage  of\\nIndian  scientists,  that  included  Vikram  Sarabhai,  Satish\\nDhawan  and  Brahm  Prakash.  They  played  major  roles  in\\nmy life and in the story of Indian science.\\nI completed sixty years of age on 15 October 1991. I had\\ndecided to devote my retirement to fulfilling what I saw as\\nmy duties in the\\n\\nsphere of social service. Instead, two things happened\\nsimultaneously.  First,  I  agreed  to  continue  in  government\\nservice  for  another  three  years  and,  next,  a  young\\ncolleague,  Arun  Tiwari,  requested  me \\nto  share  my\\nreminiscences with him, so that he could record them. He\\nwas  someone  who  had  been  working  in  my  laboratory\\nsince 1982, but I had never really known him well until the\\nFebruary  of  1987  when  I  visited  him  at  the  Intensive\\nCoronary  Care  Unit  of  the  Nizam’s  Institute  of  Medical\\nSciences in Hyderabad. He was a mere 32 years old, but\\nwas  fighting  valiantly  for  his  life.  I  asked  him  if  there  was\\nanything  he  wanted  me  to  do  for  him.  “Give  me  your\\nblessings, sir,” he said, “so that I may have a longer life and\\ncan complete at least one of your projects.”\\n\\nThe young man’s dedication moved me and I prayed for\\nhis recovery all night. The Lord answered my prayers and\\nTiwari was able to get back to work in a month. He did an\\nexcellent  job  in  helping  to  realise  the  Akash  missile\\nairframe from scratch within the short space of three years.\\nHe then took up the task of chronicling my story. Over the\\nlast year, he patiently transcribed the bits and pieces of my\\nstory  and  converted  them  into  a  fluent  narrative.  He  also\\nwent through my personal library meticulously and selected\\nfrom among the pieces of poetry those that I had marked\\nwhile reading, and included them in the text.\\n\\nThis story is an account, I hope, not just of my personal\\ntriumphs  and  tribulations  but  of  the  successes  and\\nsetbacks  of  the  science  establishment  in  modern  India,\\nstruggling to establish itself in the technological forefront. It\\nis  the  story  of  national  aspiration  and  of  cooperative\\nendeavour. And, as I see it, the saga of India’s search for\\nscientific self-sufficiency and technological competence is\\na parable for our times.\\n\\nEach  individual  creature  on  this  beautiful  planet  is\\ncreated  by  God  to  fulfil  a  particular  role.  Whatever  I  have\\nachieved in life is through His help, and an expression of\\nHis  will.  He  showered  His  grace  on  me  through  some\\noutstanding  teachers  and  colleagues,  and  when  I  pay  my\\n\\n\\x0ctributes  to  these  fine  persons,  I  am  merely  praising  His\\nglory. All these rockets and missiles are His work through a\\nsmall  person  called  Kalam,  in  order  to  tell  the  several-\\nmillion  mass  of  India,  to  never  feel  small  or  helpless.  We\\nare all born with a divine fire in us. Our efforts should be to\\ngive wings to this fire and fill the world with the glow of its\\ngoodness.\\nMay God bless you!\\nAPJ Abdul Kalam\\n\\n\\x0cI\\n\\nORIENTATION\\n[ 1931 – 1963 ]\\n\\nThis earth is His, to Him belong those vast and boundless\\nskies;Both seas within Him rest, and yet in that small pool\\nHe lies.\\nATHARVAVEDA Book 4, Hymn 16.\\n\\n\\x0c1\\n\\nI\\n\\nwas born into a middle-class Tamil family in the island\\ntown  of  Rameswaram  in  the  erstwhile  Madras  state.  My\\nfather,  Jainulabdeen,  had  neither  much  formal  education\\nnor much wealth;\\n\\ndespite  these  disadvantages,  he  possessed  great\\ninnate  wisdom  and  a  true  generosity  of  spirit.  He  had  an\\nideal helpmate in my mother, Ashiamma. I do not recall the\\nexact number of people she fed every day, but I am quite\\ncertain  that  far  more  outsiders  ate  with  us  than  all  the\\nmembers of our own family put together.\\n\\nMy  parents  were  widely  regarded  as  an  ideal  couple.\\nMy  mother’s  lineage  was  the  more  distinguished,  one  of\\nher forebears having been bestowed the title of ‘Bahadur’\\nby the British.\\n\\nI  was  one  of  many  children—a  short  boy  with  rather\\nundistinguished looks, born to tall and handsome parents.\\nWe  lived  in  our  ancestral  house,  which  was  built  in  the\\nmiddle of the 19th century. It was a fairly large pucca house,\\nmade  of  limestone  and  brick,  on  the  Mosque  Street  in\\nRameswaram.  My  austere \\nto  avoid  all\\ninessential comforts and luxuries. However, all necessities\\nwere provided for, in terms of food, medicine or clothes. In\\nfact,  I  would  say  mine  was  a  very  secure  childhood,  both\\nmaterially and emotionally.\\n\\nfather  used \\n\\nI normally ate with my mother, sitting on the floor of the\\nkitchen.  She  would  place  a  banana  leaf  before  me,  on\\nwhich she then ladled rice and aromatic sambhar, a variety\\nof sharp, home-made pickles and a dollop of fresh coconut\\nchutney.\\n\\nThe  famous  Shiva  temple,  which  made  Rameswaram\\nso  sacred  to  pilgrims,  was  about  a  ten-minute  walk  from\\nour house. Our locality was predominantly Muslim, but there\\nwere  quite  a  few  Hindu  families  too,  living  amicably  with\\ntheir Muslim neighbours. There was a very old mosque in\\nour  locality  where  my  father  would  take  me  for  evening\\nprayers.  I  had  not  the  faintest  idea  of  the  meaning  of  the\\nArabic prayers chanted, but I was totally convinced that they\\nreached  God.  When  my  father  came  out  of  the  mosque\\nafter  the  prayers,  people  of  different  religions  would  be\\nsitting outside, waiting for him. Many of them offered bowls\\nof water to my father who would dip his fingertips in them\\nand  say  a  prayer.  This  water  was  then  carried  home  for\\ninvalids. I also remember people visiting our home to offer\\nthanks  after  being  cured.  My  father  always  smiled  and\\nasked them to thank Allah, the benevolent and merciful.\\n\\nThe  high  priest  of  Rameswaram \\n\\ntemple,  Pakshi\\nLakshmana Sastry, was a very close friend of my father’s.\\nOne of the most vivid memories of my early childhood is of\\nthe  two  men,  each  in  his  traditional  attire,  discussing\\nspiritual matters. When I was old enough to ask questions, I\\nasked  my  father  about  the  relevance  of  prayer.  My  father\\ntold me there was nothing mysterious about prayer. Rather,\\nprayer made possible a communion of the spirit between\\npeople. “When you pray,” he said, “you transcend your body\\nand become a part of the cosmos, which knows no division\\nof wealth, age, caste, or creed.”\\n\\nMy  father  could  convey  complex  spiritual  concepts  in\\nvery  simple,  downto-earth  Tamil.  He  once  told  me,  “In  his\\nown time, in his own place, in what he really is, and in the\\nstage he has reached—good or bad—every human being\\nis a specific element within the whole of the manifest divine\\n\\n\\x0cBeing.  So  why  be  afraid  of  difficulties,  sufferings  and\\nproblems?  When  troubles  come,  try  to  understand  the\\nrelevance  of  your  sufferings.  Adversity  always  presents\\nopportunities for introspection.”\\n\\n“Why don’t you say this to the people who come to you\\nfor help and advice?” I asked my father. He put his hands\\non my shoulders and looked straight into my eyes. For quite\\nsome  time  he  said  nothing,  as  if  he  was  judging  my\\ncapacity to comprehend his words. Then he answered in a\\nlow, deep voice. His answer filled me with a strange energy\\nand enthusiasm:\\n\\nWhenever  human  beings  find  themselves  alone,  as  a\\nnatural reaction, they start looking for company. Whenever\\nthey  are  in  trouble,  they  look  for  someone  to  help  them.\\nWhenever they reach an impasse, they look to someone to\\nshow  them  the  way  out.  Every  recurrent  anguish,  longing,\\nand desire finds its own special helper. For the people who\\ncome to me in distress, I am but a go-between in their effort\\nto  propitiate  demonic  forces  with  prayers  and  offerings.\\nThis is not a correct approach at all and should never be\\nfollowed.  One  must  understand  the  difference  between  a\\nfear-ridden vision of destiny and the vision that enables us\\nto seek the enemy of fulfilment within ourselves.\\n\\nI  remember  my  father  starting  his  day  at  4  a.m.  by\\nreading the namaz before dawn. After the namaz, he used\\nto walk down to a small coconut grove we owned, about 4\\nmiles from our home. He would return, with about a dozen\\ncoconuts  tied  together  thrown  over  his  shoulder,  and  only\\nthen would he have his breakfast. This remained his routine\\neven when he was in his late sixties.\\n\\nI have throughout my life tried to emulate my father in my\\nown world of science and technology. I have endeavoured\\nto understand the fundamental truths revealed to me by my\\nfather, and feel convinced that there exists a divine power\\nthat can lift one up from confusion, misery, melancholy and\\nfailure,  and  guide  one  to  one’s  true  place.  And  once  an\\nindividual severs his emotional and physical bondage, he is\\non the road to freedom, happiness and peace of mind.\\n\\n(also \\n\\nto  Dhanuskodi, \\n\\nI was about six years old when my father embarked on\\nthe project of building a wooden sailboat to take pilgrims\\nfrom  Rameswaram \\ncalled\\nSethukkarai), and back. He worked at building the boat on\\nthe seashore, with the help of a relative, Ahmed Jallaluddin,\\nwho  later  married  my  sister,  Zohara.  I  watched  the  boat\\ntake  shape.  The  wooden  hull  and  bulkheads  were\\nseasoned  with  the  heat  from  wood  fires.  My  father  was\\ndoing  good  business  with  the  boat  when,  one  day,  a\\ncyclone bringing winds of over 100 miles per hour carried\\naway  our  boat,  along  with  some  of  the  landmass  of\\nSethukkarai. The Pamban Bridge collapsed with a train full\\nof passengers on it. Until then, I had only seen the beauty of\\nthe sea, now its uncontrollable energy came as a revelation\\nto me.\\n\\nBy  the  time  the  boat  met  its  untimely  end,  Ahmed\\nJallaluddin had become a close friend of mine, despite the\\ndifference in our ages. He was about 15 years older than I\\nand  used  to  call  me Azad.  We  used  to  go  for  long  walks\\ntogether every evening. As we started from Mosque Street\\nand made our way towards the sandy shores of the island,\\nJallaluddin  and  I  talked  mainly  of  spiritual  matters.  The\\natmosphere of Rameswaram, with its flocking pilgrims, was\\nconducive to such discussion. Our first halt would be at the\\nimposing temple of Lord Shiva. Circling around the temple\\nwith the same reverence as any pilgrim from a distant part\\nof the country, we felt a flow of energy pass through us.\\n\\nJallaluddin would talk about God as if he had a working\\n\\n\\x0cpartnership  with  Him.  He  would  present  all  his  doubts  to\\nGod  as  if  He  were  standing  nearby  to  dispose  of  them.  I\\nwould stare at Jallaluddin and then look towards the large\\ngroups of pilgrims around the temple, taking holy dips in the\\nsea, performing rituals and reciting prayers with a sense of\\nrespect towards the same Unknown, whom we treat as the\\nformless Almighty.  I  never  doubted  that  the  prayers  in  the\\ntemple reached the same destination as the ones offered\\nin our mosque. I only wondered whether Jallaluddin had any\\nother  special  connection  to  God.  Jallaluddin’s  schooling\\nhad  been  limited,  principally  because  of  his  family’s\\nstraitened circumstances. This may have been the reason\\nwhy he always encouraged me to excel in my studies and\\nenjoyed  my  success  vicariously.  Never  did  I  find  the\\nslightest \\nfor  his\\ndeprivation.  Rather,  he  was  always  full  of  gratitude  for\\nwhatever life had chosen to give him.\\n\\ntrace  of  resentment \\n\\nin  Jallaluddin \\n\\nIncidentally,  at  the  time  I  speak  of,  he  was  the  only\\nperson  on  the  entire  island  who  could  write  English.  He\\nwrote letters for almost anybody in need, be they letters of\\napplication  or  otherwise.  Nobody  of  my  acquaintance,\\neither  in  my  family  or  in  the  neighbourhood  even  had\\nJallaluddin’s level of education or any links of consequence\\nwith  the  outside  world.  Jallaluddin  always  spoke  to  me\\nabout  educated  people,  of  scientific  discoveries,  of\\ncontemporary  literature,  and  of  the  achievements  of\\nmedical  science.  It  was  he  who  made  me  aware  of  a\\n“brave, new world” beyond our narrow confines.\\n\\nIn  the  humble  environs  of  my  boyhood,  books  were  a\\nscarce  commodity.  By  local  standards,  however,  the\\npersonal library of STR Manickam, a former ‘revolutionary’\\nor militant nationalist, was sizeable. He encouraged me to\\nread  all  I  could  and  I  often  visited  his  home  to  borrow\\nbooks.\\n\\nAnother person who greatly influenced my boyhood was\\nmy first cousin, Samsuddin. He was the sole distributor for\\nnewspapers  in  Rameswaram.  The  newspapers  would\\narrive  at  Rameswaram  station  by  the  morning  train  from\\nPamban. Samsuddin’s newspaper agency was a one-man\\norganization catering to the reading demands of the 1,000-\\nstrong  literate  population  of  Rameswaram  town.  These\\nnewspapers were mainly bought to keep abreast of current\\ndevelopments in the National Independence Movement, for\\nto  check \\nastrological  reference  or \\nthe  bullion  rates\\nfew  readers  with  a  more\\nin  Madras.  A \\nprevailing \\ncosmopolitan  outlook  would  discuss  Hitler,  Mahatma\\nGandhi  and  Jinnah;  almost  all  would  finally  flow  into  the\\nmighty  political  current  of  Periyar  EV  Ramaswamy’s\\nmovement  against  high  caste  Hindus.  Dinamani  was  the\\nmost  sought  after  newspaper.  Since  reading  the  printed\\nmatter  was  beyond  my  capability,  I  had  to  satisfy  myself\\nwith  glancing  at  the  pictures  in  the  newspaper  before\\nSamsuddin delivered them to his customers.\\n\\nThe Second World War broke out in 1939, when I was\\neight  years  old.  For  reasons  I  have  never  been  able  to\\nunderstand, a sudden demand for tamarind seeds erupted\\nin the market. I used to collect the seeds and sell them to a\\nprovision shop on Mosque Street. A day’s collection would\\nfetch me the princely sum of one anna. Jallaluddin would tell\\nme  stories  about  the  war  which  I  would  later  attempt  to\\ntrace  in  the  headlines  in  Dinamani.  Our  area,  being\\nisolated,  was  completely  unaffected  by  the  war.  But  soon\\nIndia  was  forced  to  join  the Allied  Forces  and  something\\nlike a state of emergency was declared. The first casualty\\ncame  in  the  form  of  the  suspension  of  the  train  halt  at\\n\\n\\x0cRameswaram  station.  The  newspapers  now  had  to  be\\nbundled  and  thrown  out  from  the  moving  train  on  the\\nRameswaram  Road \\nand\\nDhanuskodi. That forced Samsuddin to look for a helping\\nhand to catch the bundles and, as if naturally, I filled the slot.\\nSamsuddin helped me earn my first wages. Half a century\\nlater,  I  can  still  feel  the  surge  of  pride  in  earning  my  own\\nmoney for the first time.\\n\\nbetween  Rameswaram \\n\\nEvery child is born, with some inherited characteristics,\\ninto a specific socio-economic and emotional environment,\\nand  trained  in  certain  ways  by  figures  of  authority.  I\\ninherited  honesty  and  self-discipline  from  my  father;  from\\nmy mother, I inherited faith in goodness and deep kindness\\nand so did my three brothers and sister. But it was the time\\nI  spent  with  Jallaluddin  and  Samsuddin  that  perhaps\\ncontributed  most  to  the  uniqueness  of  my  childhood  and\\nmade  all  the  difference  in  my  later  life.  The  unschooled\\nwisdom of Jallaluddin and Samsuddin was so intuitive and\\nresponsive \\nI  can\\nto  non-verbal  messages, \\nunhesitatingly  attribute  my  subsequently  manifested\\ncreativity to their company in my childhood.\\n\\nthat \\n\\nreligious  differences  and  upbringing. \\n\\nI had three close friends in my childhood—Ramanadha\\nSastry, Aravindan, and Sivaprakasan. All these boys were\\nfrom orthodox Hindu Brahmin families. As children, none of\\nus  ever  felt  any  difference  amongst  ourselves  because  of\\nfact,\\nour \\nRamanadha  Sastry  was  the  son  of  Pakshi  Lakshmana\\nSastry, the high priest of the Rameswaram temple. Later,\\nhe  took  over  the  priesthood  of  the  Rameswaram  temple\\nfrom  his  father;  Aravindan  went  into  the  business  of\\narranging transport for visiting pilgrims; and Sivaprakasan\\nbecame a catering contractor for the Southern Railways.\\n\\nIn \\n\\nDuring the annual Shri Sita Rama Kalyanam ceremony,\\nour family used to arrange boats with a special platform for\\ncarrying idols of the Lord from the temple to the marriage\\nsite, situated in the middle of the pond called Rama Tirtha\\nwhich was near our house. Events from the Ramayana and\\nfrom  the  life  of  the  Prophet  were  the  bedtime  stories  my\\nmother  and  grandmother  would  tell  the  children  in  our\\nfamily.\\n\\nOne  day  when  I  was  in  the  fifth  standard  at  the\\nRameswaram Elementary School, a new teacher came to\\nour  class.  I  used  to  wear  a  cap  which  marked  me  as  a\\nMuslim, and I always sat in the front row next to Ramanadha\\nSastry, who wore a sacred thread. The new teacher could\\nnot stomach a Hindu priest’s son sitting with a Muslim boy.\\nIn accordance with our social ranking as the new teacher\\nsaw it, I was asked to go and sit on the back bench. I felt\\nvery sad, and so did Ramanadha Sastry. He looked utterly\\ndowncast as I shifted to my seat in the last row. The image\\nof him weeping when I shifted to the last row left a lasting\\nimpression on me.\\n\\nAfter  school,  we  went  home  and  told  our  respective\\nparents about the incident. Lakshmana Sastry summoned\\nthe teacher, and in our presence, told the teacher that he\\nshould  not  spread  the  poison  of  social  inequality  and\\ncommunal intolerance in the minds of innocent children. He\\nbluntly  asked  the  teacher  to  either  apologize  or  quit  the\\nschool  and  the  island.  Not  only  did  the  teacher  regret  his\\nbehaviour,  but  the  strong  sense  of  conviction  Lakshmana\\nSastry conveyed ultimately reformed this young teacher.\\n\\nOn  the  whole,  the  small  society  of  Rameswaram  was\\nhighly stratified and very rigid in terms of the segregation of\\ndifferent  social  groups.  However,  my  science  teacher\\nSivasubramania  Iyer,  though  an  orthodox  Brahmin  with  a\\nvery  conservative  wife,  was  something  of  a  rebel.  He  did\\n\\n\\x0chis best to break social barriers so that people from varying\\nbackgrounds could mingle easily. He used to spend hours\\nwith me and would say, “Kalam, I want you to develop so\\nthat you are on par with the highly educated people of the\\nbig cities.”\\n\\nOne day, he invited me to his home for a meal. His wife\\nwas horrified at the idea of a Muslim boy being invited to\\ndine in her ritually pure kitchen. She refused to serve me in\\nher kitchen. Sivasubramania Iyer was not perturbed, nor did\\nhe get angry with his wife, but instead, served me with his\\nown hands and sat down beside me to eat his meal. His\\nwife watched us from behind the kitchen door. I wondered\\nwhether she had observed any difference in the way I ate\\nrice, drank water or cleaned the floor after the meal. When I\\nwas leaving his house, Sivasubramania Iyer invited me to\\njoin him for dinner again the next weekend. Observing my\\nhesitation, he told me not to get upset, saying, “Once you\\ndecide  to  change  the  system,  such  problems  have  to  be\\nconfronted.”  When  I  visited  his  house  the  next  week,\\nSivasubramania Iyer’s wife took me inside her kitchen and\\nserved me food with her own hands.\\n\\nThen  the  Second  World  War  was  over  and  India’s\\nfreedom was imminent. “Indians will build their own India,”\\ndeclared  Gandhiji.  The  whole  country  was  filled  with  an\\nunprecedented optimism. I asked my father’s permission to\\nleave Rameswaram and study at the district headquarters\\nin Ramanathapuram.\\n\\nHe told me as if thinking aloud, “Abul! I know you have\\nto go away to grow. Does the seagull not fly across the Sun,\\nalone and without a nest? You must forego your longing for\\nthe land of your memories to move into the dwelling place\\nof your greater desires; our love will not bind you nor will our\\nneeds  hold  you.”  He  quoted  Khalil  Gibran  to  my  hesitant\\nmother,  “Your  children  are  not  your  children.  They  are  the\\nsons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself. They come\\nthrough you but not from you. You may give them your love\\nbut not your thoughts. For they have their own thoughts.”\\n\\nHe took me and my three brothers to the mosque and\\nrecited the prayer Al Fatiha from the Holy Qur’an. As he put\\nme  on  the  train  at  Rameswaram  station  he  said,  “This\\nisland  may  be  housing  your  body  but  not  your  soul.  Your\\nsoul  dwells  in  the  house  of  tomorrow  which  none  of  us  at\\nRameswaram can visit, not even in our dreams. May God\\nbless you, my child!”\\n\\nSamsuddin and Ahmed Jallaluddin travelled with me to\\nRamanathapuram  to  enrol  me  in  Schwartz  High  School,\\nand to arrange for my boarding there. Somehow, I did not\\ntake to the new setting. The town of Ramanathapuram was\\na thriving, factious town of some fifty thousand people, but\\nthe coherence and harmony of Rameswaram was absent. I\\nmissed  my  home  and  grabbed  every  opportunity  to  visit\\nRameswaram.  The  pull  of  educational  opportunities  at\\nRamanathapuram  was  not  strong  enough  to  nullify  the\\nattraction of poli, a South Indian sweet my mother made. In\\nfact, she used to prepare twelve distinctly different varieties\\nof it, bringing out the flavour of every single ingredient used\\nin the best possible combinations.\\n\\nDespite my homesickness, I was determined to come\\nto  terms  with  the  new  environment  because  I  knew  my\\nfather had invested great hopes in my success. My father\\nvisualized me as a Collector in the making and I thought it\\nmy duty to realise my father’s dream, although I desperately\\nmissed \\nfamiliarity,  security  and  comforts  of\\nthe \\nRameswaram.\\n\\nJallaluddin  used  to  speak  to  me  about  the  power  of\\n\\n\\x0cpositive thinking and I often recalled his words when I felt\\nhomesick or dejected. I tried hard to do as he said, which\\nwas  to  strive  to  control  my  thoughts  and  my  mind  and,\\nthrough  these,  to  influence  my  destiny.  Ironically,  that\\ndestiny did not lead me back to Rameswaram, but rather,\\nswept me farther away from the home of my childhood.\\n* * *\\n\\n\\x0c2\\n\\nO\\n\\nnce  I  settled  down  at  the  Schwartz  High  School,\\nRamanathapuram,  the  enthusiastic  fifteen-year-old  within\\nme  re-emerged.  My  teacher,  Iyadurai  Solomon,  was  an\\nideal\\n\\nguide for an eager young mind that was yet uncertain of\\nthe possibilities and alternatives that lay before it. He made\\nhis  students  feel  very  comfortable  in  class  with  his  warm\\nand  open-minded  attitude.  He  used  to  say  that  a  good\\nstudent could learn more from a bad teacher than a poor\\nstudent from even a skilled teacher.\\n\\nDuring  my  stay  at  Ramanathapuram,  my  relationship\\nwith  him  grew  beyond  that  of  teacher  and  pupil.  In  his\\ncompany,  I  learnt  that  one  could  exercise  enormous\\ninfluence  over  the  events  of  one’s  own  life.  Iyadurai\\nSolomon  used  to  say,  “To  succeed  in  life  and  achieve\\nresults,  you  must  understand  and  master  three  mighty\\nforces— desire, belief, and expectation.” Iyadurai Solomon,\\nwho  later  became  a  Reverend,  taught  me  that  before\\nanything I wanted could happen, I had to desire it intensely\\nand  be  absolutely  certain  it  would  happen.  To  take  an\\nexample  from  my  own  life,  I  had  been  fascinated  by  the\\nmysteries  of  the  sky  and  the  flight  of  birds  from  early\\nchildhood.  I  used  to  watch  cranes  and  seagulls  soar  into\\nflight and longed to fly. Simple, provincial boy though I was, I\\nwas convinced that one day I, too, would soar up into the\\nskies. Indeed, I was the first child from Rameswaram to fly.\\nIyadurai  Solomon  was  a  great  teacher  because  he\\ninstilled  in  all  the  children  a  sense  of  their  own  worth.\\nSolomon  raised  my  self-esteem  to  a  high  point  and\\nconvinced  me,  the  son  of  parents  who  had  not  had  the\\nbenefits  of  education,  that  I  too  could  aspire  to  become\\nwhatever  I  wished.  “With  faith,  you  can  change  your\\ndestiny,” he would say.\\n\\nOne day, when I was in the fourth form, my mathematics\\nteacher,  Ramakrishna  Iyer,  was  teaching  another  class.\\nInadvertently,  I  wandered  into  that  classroom  and  in  the\\nmanner  of  an  old-fashioned  despot,  Ramakrishna  Iyer\\ncaught me by the neck and caned me in front of the whole\\nclass.  Many  months  later,  when  I  scored  full  marks  in\\nmathematics, he narrated the incident to the entire school\\nat  morning  assembly.  “Whomsoever  I  cane  becomes  a\\ngreat man! Take my word, this boy is going to bring glory to\\nhis school and to his teachers.” His praise quite made up\\nfor the earlier humiliation!\\n\\nBy the time I completed my education at Schwartz, I was\\na selfconfident boy determined to succeed. The decision to\\ngo  in  for  further  education  was  taken  without  a  second\\nthought.  To  us,  in  those  days,  the  awareness  of  the\\npossibilities  for  a  professional  education  did  not  exist;\\nhigher  education  simply  meant  going  to  college.  The\\nnearest  college  was  at  Tiruchchirappalli,  spelled\\nTrichinopoly those days, and called Trichi for short.\\n\\nIn  1950,  I  arrived  at  St.  Joseph’s  College,  Trichi,  to\\nstudy  for  the  Intermediate  examination.  I  was  not  a  bright\\nstudent  in  terms  of  examination  grades  but,  thanks  to  my\\ntwo  buddies  back  in  Rameswaram,  I  had  acquired  a\\npractical bent of mind.\\n\\nWhenever  I  returned  to  Rameswaram  from  Schwartz,\\nmy elder brother Mustafa Kamal, who ran a provision store\\non the railway station road, would call me in to give him a\\nlittle  help  and  then  vanish  for  hours  together  leaving  the\\n\\n\\x0cshop  in  my  charge.  I  sold  oil,  onions,  rice  and  everything\\nelse. The fastest moving items, I found, were cigarettes and\\nbidis.  I  used  to  wonder  what  made  poor  people  smoke\\naway their hardearned money. When spared by Mustafa, I\\nwould be put in charge of his kiosk by my younger brother,\\nKasim  Mohammed.  There  I  sold  novelties  made  of\\nseashells.\\n\\nAt  St.  Joseph’s,  I  was  lucky  to  find  a  teacher  like  the\\nRev.  Father  TN  Sequeira.  He  taught  us  English  and  was\\nalso  our  hostel  warden.  We  were  about  a  hundred  boys\\nliving  in  the  three-storeyed  hostel  building.  Rev.  Father\\nused to visit each boy every night with a Bible in his hand.\\nHis  energy  and  patience  was  amazing.  He  was  a  very\\nconsiderate person who took care of even the most minute\\nrequirements  of  his  students.  On  Deepavali,  on  his\\ninstructions,  the  Brother  in  charge  of  the  hostel  and  the\\nmess volunteers would visit each room and distribute good\\ngingelly oil for the ritual bath.\\n\\nI stayed on the St. Joseph’s campus for four years and\\nshared  my  room  with  two  others.  One  was  an  orthodox\\nIyengar  from  Srirangam  and  the  other  a  Syrian  Christian\\nfrom Kerala. The three of us had a wonderful time together.\\nWhen I was made secretary of the vegetarian mess during\\nmy  third  year  in  the  hostel,  we  invited  the  Rector,  Rev.\\nFather  Kalathil,  over  for  lunch  one  Sunday.  Our  menu\\nincluded  the  choicest  preparations  from  our  diverse\\nbackgrounds.  The  result  was  rather  unexpected,  but  Rev.\\nFather was lavish in his praise of our efforts. We enjoyed\\nevery moment with Rev. Father Kalathil, who participated in\\nour unsophisticated conversation with childlike enthusiasm.\\nIt was a memorable event for us all.\\n\\nMy  teachers  at  St.  Joseph  were  the  true  followers  of\\nKanchi  Paramacharya,  who  evoked  people  to  “enjoy  the\\naction  of  giving”.  The  vivid  memory  of  our  mathematics\\nteachers, Prof. Thothathri Iyengar and Prof. Suryanarayana\\nSastry, walking together on the campus inspires me to this\\nday.\\n\\nWhen I was in the final year at St. Joseph’s, I acquired a\\ntaste  for  English  literature.  I  began  to  read  the  great\\nclassics, Tolstoy, Scott and Hardy being special favourites\\ndespite their exotic settings, and then I moved on to some\\nworks  in  Philosophy.  It  was  around  this  time  that  I\\ndeveloped a great interest in Physics.\\n\\nThe  lessons  on  subatomic  physics  at  St.  Joseph’s  by\\nmy  physics  teachers,  Prof.  Chinna  Durai  and  Prof.\\nKrishnamurthy, introduced me to the concept of the half-life\\nperiod  and  matters  related  to  the  radioactive  decay  of\\nsubstances.  Sivasubramania  Iyer,  my  science  teacher  at\\nRameswaram,  had  never  taught  me  that  most  subatomic\\nparticles  are  unstable  and  that  they  disintegrate  after  a\\ncertain  time  into  other  particles. All  this  I  was  learning  for\\nthe first time. But when he taught me to strive with diligence\\nbecause decay is inherent in all compounded things, was\\nhe  not  talking  of  the  same  thing?  I  wonder  why  some\\npeople tend to see science as something which takes man\\naway  from  God.  As  I  look  at  it,  the  path  of  science  can\\nalways wind through the heart. For me, science has always\\nbeen the path to spiritual enrichment and self-realisation.\\n\\nEven  the  rational  thought-matrices  of  science  have\\nbeen home to fairy tales. I am an avid reader of books on\\ncosmology and enjoy reading about celestial bodies. Many\\nfriends, while asking me questions related to space flights,\\nsometimes slip into astrology. Quite honestly, I have never\\nreally understood the reason behind the great importance\\nattached  by  people  to  the  faraway  planets  in  our  solar\\nsystem. As an art, I have nothing against astrology, but if it\\n\\n\\x0cseeks acceptance under the guise of science, I reject it. I\\ndo not know how these myths evolved about planets, star\\nconstellations, and even satellites—that they can exercise\\npower  on  human  beings.  The  highly  complicated\\ncalculations manipulated around the precise movements of\\ncelestial  bodies,  to  derive  highly  subjective  conclusions\\nappear  illogical  to  me. As  I  see  it,  the  Earth  is  the  most\\npowerful  and  energetic  planet.  As  John  Milton  puts  it  so\\nbeautifully in Paradise Lost, Book VIII:\\n\\n. . . What if the Sun\\n\\nBe centre to the World, and other stars . . . . .\\nThe planet earth, so steadfast though she seem,\\nIn sensibly three different motions move?\\n\\nWherever you go on this planet, there is movement and\\nlife.  Even  apparently  inanimate  things  like  rocks,  metal,\\ntimber,  clay  are  full  of  intrinsic  movement—with  electrons\\ndancing  around  each  nucleus.  This  motion  originates  in\\ntheir response to the confinement imposed on them by the\\nnucleus, by means of electric forces which try to hold them\\nas close as possible. Electrons, just like any individual with\\na certain amount of energy, detest confinement. The tighter\\nthe electrons are held by the nucleus, the higher their orbital\\nvelocity  will  be:  in  fact,  the  confinement  of  electrons  in  an\\natom results in enormous velocities of about 1000 km per\\nsecond!  These  high  velocities  make  the  atom  appear  a\\nrigid sphere, just as a fast-moving fan appears like a disc. It\\nis  very  difficult  to  compress  atoms  more  strongly—thus\\ngiving  matter  its  familiar  solid  aspect.  Everything  solid,\\nthus,  contains  much  empty  space  within  and  everything\\nstationary  contains  great  movement  within.  It  is  as  though\\nthe  great  dance  of  Shiva  is  being  performed  on  earth\\nduring every moment of our existence.\\n\\nWhen I joined the B.Sc. degree course at St.Joseph’s, I\\nwas unaware of any other option for higher education. Nor\\ndid  I  have  any  information  about  career  opportunities\\navailable  to  a  student  of  science.  Only  after  obtaining  a\\nB.Sc. did I realise that physics was not my subject. I had to\\ngo  into  engineering  to  realise  my  dreams.  I  could  have\\njoined the Engineering course long ago, right after finishing\\nmy Intermediate course. Better late than never, I told myself\\nas  I  made  the  detour,  applying  for  admission  into  the\\nMadras  Institute  of  Technology  (MIT),  regarded  as  the\\ncrown  jewel  of  technical  education  in  South  India  at  that\\ntime.\\n\\nI managed to be on the list of selected candidates, but\\nadmission to this prestigious institution was an expensive\\naffair.  Around  a  thousand  rupees  was  required,  and  my\\nfather  could  not  spare  that  much  money. At  that  time,  my\\nsister,  Zohara,  stood  behind  me,  mortgaging  her  gold\\nbangles  and  chain. \\ntouched  by  her\\ndetermination to see me educated and by her faith in my\\nabilities.  I  vowed  to  release  her  bangles  from  mortgage\\nwith  my  own  earnings.  The  only  way  before  me  to  earn\\nmoney  at  that  point  of  time  was  to  study  hard  and  get  a\\nscholarship. I went ahead at full steam.\\n\\nI  was  deeply \\n\\nfor \\n\\nthere \\n\\nthe  various  subsystems  of \\n\\nWhat  fascinated  me  most  at  MIT  was  the  sight  of  two\\nthe\\ndecommissioned  aircraft  displayed \\ndemonstration  of \\nflying\\nmachines.  I  felt  a  strange  attraction  towards  them,  and\\nwould  sit  near  them  long  after  other  students  had  gone\\nback to the hostel, admiring man’s will to fly free in the sky,\\nlike a bird. After completing my first year, when I had to opt\\nfor  a  specific  branch,  I  almost  spontaneously  chose\\naeronautical  engineering.  The  goal  was  very  clear  in  my\\nmind now; I was going to fly aircraft. I was convinced of this,\\n\\n\\x0cdespite  being  aware  of  my  lack  of  assertiveness,  which\\nprobably came about because of my humble background.\\nAround  this  time,  I  made  special  efforts  to  try  and\\ncommunicate  with  different  kinds  of  people.  There  were\\nsetbacks, disappointments and distractions, but my father’s\\ninspiring words anchored me in those periods of nebulous\\ndrift.\\n\\nPlate 1 (a) My father Jainulabdeen was not formally\\neducated,  but  was  a  man  of  great  wisdom  and\\nkindness.

Learning without wisdom is of no\\nuse.”\\n\\nIn  the  course  of  my  education  at  MIT,  three  teachers\\nshaped  my  thinking.  Their  combined  contributions  formed\\nthe foundation on which I later built my professional career.\\nThese  three  teachers  were  Prof.  Sponder,  Prof.  KAV\\nPandalai and Prof. Narasingha Rao. Each one of them had\\nvery  distinct  personalities,  but  they  shared  a  common\\nimpulse—  the  capacity  to  feed  their  students’  intellectual\\nhunger by sheer brilliance and untiring zeal.\\n\\nrich  practical  experience \\n\\nProf.  Sponder  taught  me  technical  aerodynamics.  He\\nwas  an  Austrian  with \\nin\\naeronautical  engineering.  During  the  Second  World  War,\\nhe  had  been  captured  by  the  Nazis  and  imprisoned  in  a\\nconcentration camp. Understandably, he had developed a\\nvery  strong  dislike \\nthe\\nfor  Germans. \\naeronautical  department  was  headed  by  a  German,  Prof.\\nWalter  Repenthin.  Another  well-known  professor,  Dr  Kurt\\nTank, was a distinguished aeronautical engineer who had\\ndesigned  the  German  Focke–Wulf  FW  190  single-seater\\nfighter plane, an outstanding combat aircraft of the Second\\nWorld War. Dr Tank later joined the Hindustan Aeronautics\\nLimited  (HAL)  in  Bangalore  and  was  responsible  for  the\\ndesign of India’s first jet fighter, the HF-24 Marut.\\n\\nInciden- \\n\\ntally, \\n\\nthese \\n\\nNotwithstanding \\n\\nirritants,  Prof.  Sponder\\npreserved  his \\nindividuality  and  maintained  high\\nprofessional  standards.  He  was  always  calm,  energetic\\nand in total control of himself. He kept abreast of the latest\\n\\n\\x0ctechnologies and expected his students to do the same. I\\nconsulted  him  before  opting  for  aeronautical  engineering.\\nHe told me that one should never worry about one’s future\\nprospects:  instead,  it  was  more  important  to  lay  sound\\nfoundations, \\nto  have  sufficient  enthusiasm  and  an\\naccompanying passion for one’s chosen field of study. The\\ntrouble  with  Indians,  Prof.  Sponder  used  to  observe,  was\\nnot that they lacked educational opportunities or industrial\\ninfrastructure—the \\nto\\ndiscriminate  between  disciplines  and  to  rationalise  their\\nchoices. Why aeronautics? Why not electrical engineering?\\nWhy not mechanical engineering? I myself would like to tell\\nall  novitiate  engineering  students  that  when  they  choose\\ntheir  specialization,  the  essential  point  to  consider  is\\nwhether  the  choice  articulates  their  inner  feelings  and\\naspirations.\\n\\ntrouble  was \\n\\nfailure \\n\\ntheir \\n\\nin \\n\\nProf.  KAV  Pandalai  taught  me  aero-structure  design\\nand  analysis.  He  was  a  cheerful,  friendly  and  enthusiastic\\nteacher,  who  brought  a  fresh  approach  to  every  year’s\\nteaching course. It was Professor Pandalai who opened up\\nthe  secrets  of  structural  engineering  to  us.  Even  today  I\\nbelieve  that  everyone  who  has  been  taught  by  Prof.\\nPandalai  would  agree  that  he  was  a  man  of  great\\nintellectual  integrity  and  scholarship—but  with  no  trace  of\\narrogance. His students were free to disagree with him on\\nseveral points in the classroom.\\n\\nProf. Narasingha Rao was a mathematician, who taught\\nus theoretical aerodynamics. I still remember his method of\\nteaching  fluid  dynamics.  After  attending  his  classes,  I\\nbegan to prefer mathematical physics to any other subject.\\nOften,  I  have  been  told  I  carry  a  “surgical  knife”  to\\naeronautical  design  reviews.  If  it  had  not  been  for  Prof.\\nRao’s  kind  and  persistent  advice  on  picking  up  proofs  to\\nequations of aerodynamic flow, I would not have acquired\\nthis metaphorical tool.\\n\\nAeronautics is a fascinating subject, containing within it\\nthe  promise  of  freedom.  The  great  difference  between\\nfreedom  and  escape,  between  motion  and  movement,\\nbetween slide and flow are the secrets of this science. My\\nteachers  revealed  these  truths  to  me.  Through  their\\nmeticulous teaching, they created within me an excitement\\nabout  aeronautics.  Their  intellectual  fervour,  clarity  of\\nthought and passion for perfection helped me to launch into\\na  serious  study  of  fluid  dynamicsmodes  of  compressible\\nmedium motion, development of shock waves and shock,\\ninduced flow separation at increasing speeds, shock stall\\nand shock-wave drag.\\n\\nSlowly, a great amalgamation of information took place\\nin my mind. The structural features of aeroplanes began to\\ngain  new  meanings—  biplanes,  monoplanes,  tailless\\nplanes,  canard  configured  planes,  deltawing  planes,  all\\nthese began to assume increasing significance for me. The\\nthree teachers, all of them authorities in their different fields,\\nhelped me to mould a composite knowledge.\\n\\nMy  third  and  last  year  at  MIT  was  a  year  of  transition\\nand  was  to  have  a  great  impact  on  my  later  life.  In  those\\ndays, a new climate of political enlightenment and industrial\\neffort  was  sweeping  across  the  country.  I  had  to  test  my\\nbelief  in  God  and  see  if  it  could  fit  into  the  matrix  of\\nscientific thinking. The accepted view was that a belief in\\nscientific  methods  was \\nto\\nknowledge. If so, I wondered, was matter alone the ultimate\\nreality and were spiritual phenomena but a manifestation of\\nmatter?  Were  all  ethical  values  relative,  and  was  sensory\\nperception  the  only  source  of  knowledge  and  truth?  I\\nwondered  about  these  issues,  attempting  to  sort  out  the\\n\\nthe  only  valid  approach \\n\\n\\x0cwondered  about  these  issues,  attempting  to  sort  out  the\\nvexing question of “scientific temper” and my own spiritual\\ninterests.  The  value  system  in  which  I  had  been  nurtured\\nwas profoundly religious. I had been taught that true reality\\nlay beyond the material world in the spiritual realm, and that\\nknowledge  could  be  obtained  only \\ninner\\nexperience.\\n\\nthrough \\n\\nMeanwhile, when I had finished my course work, I was\\nassigned  a  project  to  design  a  low-level  attack  aircraft\\ntogether  with  four  other  colleagues.  I  had  taken  up  the\\nresponsibility  of  preparing  and  drawing  the  aerodynamic\\ndesign. My team mates distributed among themselves the\\ntasks  of  designing  the  propulsion,  structure,  control  and\\ninstrumentation of the aircraft. One day, my design teacher,\\nProf. Srinivasan, then the Director of the MIT, reviewed my\\nprogress  and  declared  it  dismal  and  disappointing.  I\\noffered  a  dozen  excuses  for  the  delay,  but  none  of  them\\nimpressed Prof. Srinivasan. I finally pleaded for a month’s\\ntime to complete the task. The Professor looked at me for\\nsome  time  and  said,  “Look,  young  man,  today  is  Friday\\nafternoon. I give you three days’ time. If by Monday morning\\nI  don’t  get  the  configuration  drawing,  your  scholarship  will\\nbe  stopped.”  I  was  dumbstruck.  The  scholarship  was  my\\nlifeline and I would be quite helpless if it was withdrawn. I\\ncould see no other way out but to finish the task as I had\\nbeen  instructed.  That  night,  I  remained  at  the  drawing\\nboard, skipping dinner. Next morning, I took only an hour’s\\nbreak  to  freshen  up  and  eat  a  little  food.  On  Sunday\\nmorning,  I  was  very  near  completion,  when  suddenly  I  felt\\nsomeone  else’s  presence  in  the  room.  Prof.  Srinivasan\\nwas watching me from a distance. Coming straight from the\\ngymkhana, he was still in his tennis outfit and had dropped\\nin  to  see  my  progress.  After  examining  my  work,  Prof.\\nSrinivasan hugged me affectionately and patted my back in\\nappreciation.  He  said,  “I  knew  I  was  putting  you  under\\nstress  and  asking  you  to  meet  an  impossible  deadline.  I\\nnever expected you to perform so well.”\\n\\nDuring the rest of the period of the project, I participated\\nin  an  essay  competition  organized  by  the  MIT  Tamil\\nSangam (Literary Society). Tamil is my mother tongue and I\\nam  proud  of  its  origins,  which  have  been  traced  back  to\\nSage  Agastya  in  the  pre-Ramayana  period;  its  literature\\ndates  back  to  the  fifth  century  BC.  It  is  said  to  be  a\\nlanguage  moulded  by  lawyers  and  grammarians  and  is\\ninternationally  acclaimed  for  its  clear-cut  logic.  I  was  very\\nenthusiastic  about  ensuring  that  science  did  not  remain\\noutside the purview of this wonderful language. I wrote an\\narticle entitled “Let Us Make Our Own Aircraft” in Tamil. The\\narticle  evoked  much  interest  and  I  won  the  competition,\\ntaking the first prize from ‘Devan’, the editor of the popular\\nTamil weekly, Ananda Vikatan.\\n\\nMy  most  touching  memory  of  MIT  is  related  to  Prof.\\nSponder. We were posing for a group photograph as part\\nof a farewell ritual. All the graduating students had lined up\\nin  three  rows  with  the  professors  seated  in  the  front.\\nSuddenly, Prof. Sponder got up and looked for me. I was\\nstanding  in  the  third  row.  “Come  and  sit  with  me  in  the\\nfront,”  he  said.  I  was  taken  aback  by  Prof.  Sponder’s\\ninvitation. “You are my best student and hard work will help\\nyou  bring  a  great  name  for  your  teachers  in  future.”\\nEmbarrassed  by \\nthe\\nrecognition,  I  sat  with  Prof.  Sponder  for  the  photograph.\\n“Let God be your hope, your stay, your guide and provide\\nthe lantern for your feet in your journey into the future,” said\\nthe introverted genius, bidding me adieu.\\n\\nthe  praise  but  honoured  by \\n\\nFrom  MIT,  I  went  to  Hindustan  Aeronautics  Limited\\n\\n\\x0c(HAL) at Bangalore as a trainee. There I worked on engine\\noverhauling  as  part  of  a  team.  Hands-on  work  on  aircraft\\nengine  overhauling  was  very  educative.  When  a  principle\\nlearnt in the classroom is borne out by practical experience,\\nit  creates  a  strange  sense  of  excitement—akin \\nto\\nunexpectedly running into an old friend among a crowd of\\nstrangers.  At  HAL,  I  worked  on  the  overhauling  of  both\\npiston  and  turbine  engines.  The  hazy  concepts  of  gas\\ndynamics and diffusion processes in the working principle\\nof after burning came into sharper focus in my mind. I was\\nalso trained in radial engine-cum-drum operations.\\n\\nI learned how to check a crankshaft for wear and tear,\\nand  a  connecting  rod  and  crankshaft  for  twist.  I  did\\ncalibrations  of  a  fixedpitch  fan  fitted  to  a  super-charged\\nengine. I opened up pressure and acceleration-cum-speed\\ncontrol  systems,  and  air  starter  supply  systems  of  turbo-\\nengines.  Getting  to  understand  feathering,  un-feathering\\nand  reversing  of  propeller  engines  was  very  interesting.\\nThe demonstration of the delicate art of beta (blade angle\\ncontrol) by HAL technicians still lingers in my memory. They\\nhad  neither  studied  in  major  universities,  nor  were  they\\nmerely  implementing  what  their  engineer-in-charge  was\\nsuggesting. They had been working hands-on for years and\\nthis had given them something like an intuitive feel for the\\nwork.\\n\\nTwo  alternative  opportunities  for  employment,  both\\nclose  to  my  longstanding  dream  of  flying,  presented\\nthemselves  before  me  when  I  came  out  of  HAL  as  a\\ngraduate  aeronautical  engineer.  One  was  a  career  in  the\\nAir  Force  and  another  was  a  job  at  the  Directorate  of\\nTechnical  Development  and  Production,  DTD&P(Air),  at\\nthe  Ministry  of  Defence.  I  applied  for  both.  The  interview\\ncalls arrived from both the places almost simultaneously. I\\nwas  asked  to  reach  Dehra  Dun  by  the  Air  Force\\nrecruitment authorities and Delhi by DTD&P(Air). The boy\\nfrom  the  Coromandel  Coast  took  a  train  to  the  North  of\\nIndia.  My  destination  was  more  than  2000  km  away,  and\\nwas  to  be  my  first  encounter  with  the  vastness  of  my\\nmotherland.\\n* * *\\n\\n\\x0c3\\n\\nT\\n\\nhrough  the  window  of  the  compartment,  I  watched  the\\ncountryside slip past. From a distance, the men in the fields\\nin  their  white  dhotis  and  turbans,  and  the  womenfolk  in\\nbright\\n\\nsplashes  of  colour  against  the  green  background  of\\npaddy fields, seemed to inhabit some beautiful painting. I\\nsat glued to the window. Almost everywhere, people were\\nengaged  in  some  activity  which  had  a  rhythm  and\\ntranquillity  about  it—men  driving  cattle,  women  fetching\\nwater  from  streams.  Occasionally,  a  child  would  appear\\nand wave at the train.\\n\\nIt  is  astonishing  how  the  landscape  changes  as  one\\nmoves  northwards.  The  rich  and  fertile  plains  of  the  river\\nGanga and its numerous tributaries have invited invasion,\\nturmoil, and change. Around 1500 BC, fair-skinned Aryans\\nswept  in  through  the  mountain  passes  from  the  far  north-\\nwest. The tenth century brought Muslims, who later mingled\\nwith  the  local  people  and  became  an  integral  part  of  this\\ncountry.  One  empire  gave  way  to  another.  Religious\\nconquests continued. All this time, the part of India south of\\nthe  Tropic  of  Cancer  remained  largely  untouched,  safe\\nbehind  the  shield  of  the  Vindhya  and  Satpura  mountain\\nranges.  The  Narmada,  Tapti,  Mahanadi,  Godavari,  and\\nKrishna  rivers  had  woven  a  net  of  almost  unassailable\\nprotection for the tapering Indian peninsula. To bring me to\\nDelhi,  my  train  had  crossed  all  these  geographical\\nimpediments through the power of scientific advancement.\\nI  halted  for  a  week  in  Delhi,  the  city  of  the  great  Sufi\\nSaint Hazrat Nizamuddin, and appeared for the interview at\\nDTD&P(Air). I did well at the interview. The questions were\\nof a routine nature, and did not challenge my knowledge of\\nthe  subject.  Then  I  proceeded  to  Dehra  Dun  for  my\\ninterview at the Air Force Selection Board. At the Selection\\nBoard,  the  emphasis  was  more  on  “personality”  than  on\\nintelligence. Perhaps they were looking for physical fitness\\nand  an  articulate  manner.  I  was  excited  but  nervous,\\ndetermined  but  anxious,  confident  but  tense.  I  could  only\\nfinish  ninth  in  the  batch  of  25  examined  to  select  eight\\nofficers  for  commissioning  in  the Air  Force.  I  was  deeply\\ndisappointed. It took me some time to comprehend that the\\nopportunity to join the Air Force had just slipped through my\\nfingers.  I  dragged  myself  out  of  the  Selection  Board  and\\nstood at the edge of a cliff. There was a lake far below. I\\nknew  that  the  days  ahead  would  be  difficult.  There  were\\nquestions  to  be  answered  and  a  plan  of  action  to  be\\nprepared. I trekked down to Rishikesh.\\n\\nI  bathed  in  the  Ganga  and  revelled  in  the  purity  of  its\\nwater. Then, I walked to the Sivananda Ashram situated a\\nlittle  way  up  the  hill.  I  could  feel  intense  vibrations  when  I\\nentered. I saw a large number of sadhus seated all around\\nin  a  state  of  trance.  I  had  read  that  sadhus  were  psychic\\npeople—people  who  know  things  intuitively  and,  in  my\\ndejected  mood,  I  sought  answers  to  the  doubts  that\\ntroubled me.\\n\\nI  met  Swami  Sivananda—a  man  who  looked  like  a\\nBuddha, wearing a snow-white dhoti and wooden slippers.\\nHe had an olive complexion and black, piercing eyes. I was\\nstruck  by  his  irresistible,  almost  childlike  smile  and\\ngracious  manner.  I  introduced  myself  to  the  Swamiji.  My\\nMuslim  name  aroused  no  reaction  in  him.  Before  I  could\\nspeak  any  further,  he  inquired  about  the  source  of  my\\n\\n\\x0csorrow.  He  offered  no  explanation  of  how  he  knew  that  I\\nwas sad and I did not ask.\\n\\nI  told  him  about  my  unsuccessful  attempt  to  join  the\\nIndian Air  Force  and  my  long-cherished  desire  to  fly.  He\\nsmiled, washing away all my anxiety almost instantly. Then\\nhe said in a feeble, but very deep voice,\\n\\nDesire, when it stems from the heart and spirit, when it\\nis pure and intense, possesses awesome electromagnetic\\nenergy. This energy is released into the ether each night,\\nas  the  mind  falls  into  the  sleep  state.  Each  morning  it\\nreturns  to  the  conscious  state  reinforced  with  the  cosmic\\ncurrents.  That  which  has  been  imaged  will  surely  and\\ncertainly be manifested. You can rely, young man, upon this\\nageless  promise  as  surely  as  you  can  rely  upon  the\\neternally unbroken promise of sunrise... and of Spring.\\n\\nWhen  the  student  is  ready,  the  teacher  will  appear—\\nHow  true!  Here  was  the  teacher  to  show  the  way  to  a\\nstudent who had nearly gone astray! “Accept your destiny\\nand  go  ahead  with  your  life.  You  are  not  destined  to\\nbecome  an  Air  Force  pilot.  What  you  are  destined  to\\nbecome is not revealed now but it is predetermined. Forget\\nthis failure, as it was essential to lead you to your destined\\npath.  Search,  instead,  for  the  true  purpose  of  your\\nexistence.  Become  one  with  yourself,  my  son!  Surrender\\nyourself to the wish of God,” Swamiji said.\\n\\nI  returned  to  Delhi  and  enquired  at  the  DTD&P(Air)\\nabout  the  outcome  of  my  interview.  In  response,  I  was\\nhanded  my  appointment  letter.  I  joined  the  next  day  as\\nSenior  Scientific Assistant  on  a  basic  salary  of  Rs  250/-\\nper month. If this was to be my destiny, I thought, let it be so.\\nFinally,  I  was  filled  with  mental  peace.  No  more  did  I  feel\\nany bitterness or resentment at my failure to enter the Air\\nForce. All this was in 1958.\\n\\nAt the Directorate, I was posted at the Technical Centre\\n(Civil Aviation). If I was not flying aeroplanes, I was at least\\nhelping to make them airworthy. During my first year in the\\nDirectorate, \\nI  carried  out  a  design  assignment  on\\nsupersonic  target  aircraft  with  the  help  of  the  officer-in-\\ncharge, R Varadharajan, and won a word of praise from the\\nDirector,  Dr  Neelakantan.  To  gain  shop-floor  exposure  to\\naircraft  maintenance,  I  was  sent  to  the  Aircraft  and\\nArmament  Testing  Unit  (A&ATU)  at  Kanpur. At  that  time,\\nthey  were  involved  in  a  tropical  evaluation  of  Gnat  Mk  I\\naircraft. I participated in the performance assessment of its\\noperation systems.\\n\\nEven in those days, Kanpur was a very populous city. It\\nwas my first experience of living in an industrial town. The\\ncold  weather,  crowds,  noise  and  smoke  were  in  total\\ncontrast  to  what  I  was  used  to  in  Rameswaram.  I  was\\nparticularly troubled by the ubiquitous presence of potatoes\\non the dining table, right from breakfast to dinner. To me, it\\nseemed that a feeling of loneliness pervaded the city. The\\npeople  on  the  streets  had  all  come  from  their  villages  in\\nsearch of jobs in factories, leaving behind the smell of their\\nsoil and the protection of their families.\\n\\nOn my return to Delhi, I was informed that the design of\\na DART target had been taken up at the DTD&P (Air) and\\nthat  I  had  been  included  in  the  design  team.  I  completed\\nthis task with the other team members. Then, I undertook a\\npreliminary  design  study  on  a  Human  Centrifuge.  I  later\\ncarried  out  the  design  and  development  of  a  Vertical\\nTakeoff and Landing Platform. I was also associated with\\nthe development and construction of the Hot Cockpit. Three\\nyears  passed.  Then \\nthe  Aeronautical  Development\\nEstablishment  (ADE)  was  born  in  Bangalore  and  I  was\\nposted to the new establishment.\\n\\n\\x0cfor  a  single  allegiance. \\n\\nBangalore as a city was in direct contrast to Kanpur. In\\nfact, I feel our country has an uncanny way of bringing out\\nextremes  in  her  people.  I  suppose,  it  is  because  Indians\\nhave  been  both  afflicted  and  enriched  by  centuries  of\\nmigrations.  Loyalty  to  different  rulers  has  dulled  our\\nInstead,  we  have\\ncapacity \\ndeveloped  an  extraordinary  ability  to  be  compassionate\\nand cruel, sensitive and callous, deep and fickle, all at the\\nsame time. To the untrained eye, we may appear colourful\\nand  picturesque;  to  the  critical  eye,  we  are  but  shoddy\\nimitations  of  our  various  masters.  In  Kanpur,  I  saw  paan-\\nchewing imitations of Wajid Ali Shah, and in Bangalore it\\nwas replaced by dog-walking sahibs. Here too, I longed for\\nthe depth and calmness of Rameswaram. The relationship\\nbetween  the  heart  and  the  head  of  an  earthy  Indian  has\\nbeen  eroded  by  the  divided  sensibilities  of  our  cities.  I\\nspent  my  evenings  exploring  the  gardens  and  shopping\\nplazas of Bangalore.\\n\\nThe  workload  at  ADE  during  the  first  year  of  its\\ninception was quite light. In fact, I had to generate work for\\nmyself at first, until the tempo gradually built up. Based on\\nmy  preliminary  studies  on  ground-handling  equipment,  a\\nproject  team  was  formed  to  design  and  develop  an\\nindigenous  hovercraft  prototype  as  a  ground  equipment\\nmachine  (GEM).  The  team  was  a  small  working  group,\\ncomprising four persons at the level of Scientific Assistant.\\nDr OP Mediratta, Director of the ADE, asked me to lead\\nthe  team.  We  were  given  three  years  to  launch  the\\nengineering model.\\n\\nThe  project  was,  by  any  standards,  bigger  than  our\\ncollective  capabilities.  None  of  us  had  any  experience  in\\nbuilding a machine, let alone a flying machine. There were\\nno  designs  or  standard  components  available  to  begin\\nwith. All  we  knew  was  that  we  had  to  make  a  successful\\nheavier-than-air flying machine. We tried to read as much\\nliterature as we could find on hovercrafts, but there was not\\nmuch available. We tried to consult people knowledgeable\\nin this area, but could find none. One day, I simply took the\\ndecision  to  proceed  with  the  limited  information  and\\nresources available.\\n\\nThis  endeavour  to  produce  a  wingless,  light,  swift\\nmachine  opened  the  windows  of  my  mind.  I  was  quick  to\\nsee  at \\nleast  a  metaphorical  connection  between  a\\nhovercraft  and  an  aircraft.  After  all,  the  Wright  Brothers\\nmade  the  first  aeroplane  after  fixing  bicycles  for  seven\\nyears!  I  saw  in  the  GEM  project  great  opportunities  for\\ningenuity  and  growth.  We  went  straight  into  hardware\\ndevelopment after spending a few months on the drawing\\nboard.\\n\\nThere is always the danger that a person with my kind of\\nbackground—  rural  or  small-town,  middle-class,  whose\\nparents  had  limited  education—  will  retreat  into  a  corner\\nand  remain  there  struggling  for  bare  existence,  unless\\nsome great turn of circumstance propels him into a more\\nfavourable  environment.  I  knew  I  had  to  create  my  own\\nopportunities.\\n\\nPart by part, subsystem by subsystem, stage by stage,\\nthings  started  moving.  Working  on  this  project,  I  learned\\nthat once your mind stretches to a new level it never goes\\nback to its original dimension.\\n\\nAt  that  time  VK  Krishna  Menon  was  the  Defence\\nMinister.  He  was  keenly  interested  in  the  progress  of  our\\nsmall project, which he envisioned as the beginning of the\\nindigenous  development  of  India’s  defence  equipment.\\nWhenever  he  was  in  Bangalore,  he  always  found  some\\n\\n\\x0ctime to review the progress of our project. His confidence in\\nour  ability  ignited  our  enthusiasm.  I  would  enter  the\\nassembly shop leaving my other problems outside, just as\\nmy father used to enter the mosque for prayer, leaving his\\nshoes outside.\\n\\nBut  not  everyone  accepted  Krishna  Menon’s  opinion\\nabout GEM. Our experiments with the available parts and\\ncomponents  did  not  exactly  delight  my  senior  colleagues.\\nMany  even  called  us  a  group  of  eccentric  inventors  in\\npursuit of an impossible dream. I, being the leader of the\\n“navvies”, was a particularly inviting target. I was regarded\\nas yet another country bumpkin who believed that riding the\\nair  was  his  domain.  The  weight  of  opinion  against  us\\nbuttressed  my  ever-optimistic  mind.  The  comments  of\\nsome of the senior scientists at ADE made me recall John\\nthe  Wright\\nfamous  satirical  poem  on \\nTrowbridge’s \\nBrothers, published in 1896:\\n\\n. . . . with thimble and thread\\n\\nAnd wax and hammer, and buckles and screws,\\nAnd all such things as geniuses use; —\\nTwo bats for patterns, curious fellows!\\nA charcoal-pot and a pair of bellows.\\n\\nlay \\n\\nWhen  the  project  was  about  a  year  old,  Defence\\nMinister  Krishna  Menon  made  one  of  his  routine  visits  to\\nADE. I escorted him into our assembly shop. Inside, on a\\ntable \\ninto  sub-\\nthe  GEM  model  broken  down \\nassemblies. The model represented the culmination of one\\nyear’s  untiring  efforts  to  develop  a  practical  hovercraft  for\\nbattlefield  applications.  The  minister  fired  one  question\\nafter another at me, determined to ensure that the prototype\\nwould go into test flight within the coming year. He told Dr\\nMediratta, “GEM flight is possible with the gadgets Kalam\\nnow possesses”.\\n\\nThe  hovercraft  was  christened  Nandi,  after  the  bull\\nridden by Lord Shiva. For a prototype, its form, fit and finish\\nwas  beyond  our  expectation,  given \\nthe  rudimentary\\ninfrastructure we possessed. I told my colleagues, “Here is\\na flying machine, not constructed by a bunch of cranks but\\nby  engineers  of  ability.  Don’t  look  at  it—it  is  not  made  to\\nlook at, but to fly with.”\\n\\nDefence  Minister  Krishna  Menon  flew  in  the  Nandi,\\noverruling  the  accompanying  officials’  concern  for  his\\nsafety. A Group Captain in the minister’s troupe, who had\\nlogged in many thousands of flying hours, even offered to fly\\nthe machine to save the minister from the potential danger\\nof flying with an inexperienced civilian pilot like myself and\\ngestured  to  me  to  come  out  of  the  machine.  I  was  sure\\nabout  my  competence  in  flying  the  machine  I  had  made,\\nand  therefore  shook  my  head  in  negation.  Observing  this\\nwordless  communication,  Krishna  Menon  dismissed  the\\ninsulting suggestion of the Group Captain with a laugh and\\nsignalled to me to start the machine. He was very happy.\\n“You  have  demonstrated  that  the  basic  problems  of\\nhovercraft development are solved. Go for a more powerful\\nprime mover and call me for a second ride,” Krishna Menon\\ntold  me.  The  skeptical  Group  Captain  (now  Air  Marshal)\\nGolay, later became a good friend of mine.\\n\\nWe completed the project ahead of schedule. We had a\\nworking  hovercraft  with  us,  moving  on  an  air  cushion  of\\nabout 40mm with a load of 550kg, including the tare weight.\\nDr Mediratta was visibly pleased with the achievement. But\\nby this time, Krishna Menon was out of office and could not\\ntake his promised second ride. In the new order, not many\\npeople  shared  his  dream  with \\nto  military\\napplications  of  an  indigenous  hovercraft.  In  fact,  even\\n\\nregard \\n\\n\\x0ctoday,  we  import  hovercrafts.  The  project  was  mired  in\\ncontroversies  and  was  finally  shelved.  It  was  a  new\\nexperience for me. So far, I had believed that the sky was\\nthe  limit,  but  now  it  appeared  that  the  limits  were  much\\ncloser. There are boundaries that dictate life: you can only\\nlift so much weight; you can only learn so fast; you can only\\nwork so hard; you can only go so far!\\n\\nI was unwilling to face reality. I had put my heart and soul\\ninto  Nandi.  That  it  would  not  be  used  was  something\\nbeyond  my  comprehension.  I  was  disappointed  and\\ndisillusioned.  In  this  period  of  confusion  and  uncertainty,\\nmemories  from  my  childhood  came  back  to  me  and  I\\ndiscovered new meanings in them.\\n\\nPakshi Sastry used to say, “Seek the truth, and the truth\\nshall  set  you  free.” As  the  Bible  says,  “Ask  and  you  shall\\nreceive.”  It  did  not  happen  immediately,  but  it  happened\\nnevertheless. One day, Dr Mediratta called me. He inquired\\nabout  the  state  of  our  hovercraft.  When  told  that  it  was  in\\nperfect  condition  to  be  flown,  he  asked  me  to  organize  a\\ndemonstration for an important visitor the next day. No VIP\\nwas scheduled to visit the laboratory during the next week\\nas far as I knew. However, I communicated Dr Mediratta’s\\ninstructions  to  my  colleagues  and  we  felt  a  new  surge  of\\nhope.\\n\\nThe  next  day  Dr  Mediratta  brought  a  visitor  to  our\\nhovercraft—a tall, handsome, bearded man. He asked me\\nseveral  questions  about  the  machine.  I  was  struck  by  the\\nobjectivity  and  clarity  of  his  thinking.  “Can  you  give  me  a\\nride  in  the  machine?”  he  enquired.  His  request  filled  me\\nwith joy. Finally, here was someone who was interested in\\nmy work.\\n\\nWe  took  a  ten-minute  ride  in  the  hovercraft,  a  few\\ncentimetres above the ground. We were not flying, but were\\ndefinitely  floating  in  the  air.  The  visitor  asked  me  a  few\\nquestions  about  myself,  thanked  me  for  the  ride  and\\ndeparted. But not before introducing himself—he was Prof.\\nMGK Menon, Director of the Tata Institute of Fundamental\\nResearch  (TIFR). After  a  week,  I  received  a  call  from  the\\nIndian  Committee  for  Space  Research  (INCOSPAR),  to\\nattend  an  interview  for  the  post  of  Rocket  Engineer. All  I\\nknew about INCOSPAR at that time was that it was formed\\nout  of  the  TIFR  talent  pool  at  Bombay  (now  Mumbai)  to\\norganize space research in India.\\n\\nI went to Bombay to attend the interview. I was unsure\\nabout  the  type  of  questions  I  would  have  to  face  at  the\\ninterview. There was hardly any time to read up or talk to\\nany  experienced  person.  Lakshmana  Sastry’s  voice\\nquoting from the Bhagawad Gita echoed in my ears:\\n\\nAll beings are born to delusion . . . overcome by the\\ndualities which arise from wish and hate . . . . But those\\nmen of virtuous deeds in whom sin has come to an end,\\nfreed from the delusion of dualities, worship Me steadfast\\nin their vows.\\n\\nI  reminded  myself  that  the  best  way  to  win  was  to  not\\nneed  to  win.  The  best  performances  are  accomplished\\nwhen you are relaxed and free of doubt. I decided to take\\nthings as they came. Since neither Prof. MGK Menon’s visit\\nnor  the  call  for  an  interview  had  been  of  my  making,  I\\ndecided this was the best attitude to take.\\n\\nI  was  interviewed  by  Dr  Vikram  Sarabhai  along  with\\nProf. MGK Menon and Mr Saraf, then the Deputy Secretary\\nof the Atomic Energy Commission. As I entered the room, I\\nsensed  their  warmth  and  friendliness.  I  was  almost\\nimmediately  struck  by  Dr  Sarabhai’s  warmth.  There  was\\nnone  of  the  arrogance  or  the  patronising  attitudes  which\\n\\n\\x0cinterviewers  usually  display  when  talking  to  a  young  and\\nvulnerable  candidate.  Dr  Sarabhai’s  questions  did  not\\nprobe my existing knowledge or skills; rather they were an\\nexploration  of  the  possibilities  I  was  filled  with.  He  was\\nlooking at me as if in reference to a larger whole. The entire\\nencounter seemed to me a total moment of truth, in which\\nmy dream was enveloped by the larger dream of a bigger\\nperson.\\n\\nI  was  advised  to  stay  back  for  a  couple  of  days.\\nHowever, the next evening I was told about my selection. I\\nwas to be absorbed as a rocket engineer at INCOSPAR.\\nThis was a breakthrough a young man like myself dreamed\\nof.\\n\\nMy  work  at \\n\\nINCOSPAR  commenced  with  a\\nfamiliarization  course  at  the  TIFR  Computer  Centre.  The\\natmosphere  here  was  remarkably  different  from  that  at\\nDTD&P  (AIR).  Labels  mattered  very  little.  There  was  no\\nneed  for  anyone  to  justify  his  position  or  to  be  at  the\\nreceiving end of the others’ hostility.\\n\\nSome time in the latter half of 1962, INCOSPAR took\\nthe  decision  to  set  up  the  Equatorial  Rocket  Launching\\nStation at Thumba, a sleepy fishing village near Trivandrum\\n(now  Thiruvananthapuram)  in  Kerala.  Dr  Chitnis  of  the\\nPhysical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad had spotted it\\nas  a  suitable  location  as  it  was  very  close  to  the  earth’s\\nmagnetic equator. This was the quiet beginning of modern\\nrocket-based  research  in  India.  The  site  selected  at\\nThumba  lay  between  the  railway  line  and  the  sea  coast,\\ncovering  a  distance  of  about  two  and  a  half  km  and\\nmeasuring about 600 acres. Within this area, stood a large\\nchurch,  whose  site  had  to  be  acquired.  Land  acquisition\\nfrom  private  parties  is  always  a  difficult  and  time-\\nconsuming process, especially in densely populated places\\nlike  Kerala.  In  addition,  there  was  the  delicate  matter  of\\nacquiring  a  site  of  religious  significance.  The  Collector  of\\nTrivandrum then, K Madhavan Nair, executed this task in a\\nmost  tactful,  peaceful  and  expeditious  manner,  with  the\\nblessings  and  cooperation  of  Right  Rev.  Dr  Dereira,  who\\nwas the Bishop of Trivandrum in 1962. Soon RD John, the\\nexecutive engineer of the Central Public Works Department\\n(CPWD),  had  transformed  the  entire  area.  The  St.  Mary\\nMagdalene  church  housed  the  first  office  of  the  Thumba\\nSpace Centre. The prayer room was my first laboratory, the\\nBishop’s room was my design and drawing office. To this\\nday, the church is maintained in its full glory and, at present,\\nhouses the Indian Space Museum.\\n\\nVery soon after this, I was asked to proceed to America\\nfor  a  sixmonth  training  programme  on  sounding  rocket\\nlaunching  techniques,  at  the  National  Aeronautics  and\\nSpace Administration  (NASA)  work  centres.  I  took  some\\ntime  off  before  going  abroad  and  went  to  Rameswaram.\\nMy father was very pleased to learn about the opportunity\\nthat  had  come  my  way.  He  took  me  to  the  mosque  and\\norganized a special namaz in thanksgiving. I could feel the\\npower of God flowing in a circuit through my father to me\\nand back to God; we were all under the spell of the prayer.\\nOne of the important functions of prayer, I believe, is to\\nact as a stimulus to creative ideas. Within the mind are all\\nthe  resources  required  for  successful  living.  Ideas  are\\npresent  in  the  consciousness,  which  when  released  and\\ngiven  scope  to  grow  and  take  shape,  can  lead  to\\nsuccessful events. God, our Creator, has stored within our\\nminds  and  personalities,  great  potential  strength  and\\nability. Prayer helps us to tap and develop these powers.\\n\\nAhmed Jallaluddin and Samsuddin came to see me off\\nat Bombay airport. It was their first exposure to a big city\\n\\n\\x0clike  Bombay,  just  as  I  myself  was  about  to  have  my  first\\nexposure  to  a  mega  city  like  New  York.  Jallaluddin  and\\nSamsuddin were self-reliant, positive, optimistic men who\\nundertook  their  work  with  the  assurance  of  success.  It  is\\nfrom these two persons that I drew the core creative power\\nof  my  mind.  My  sentiments  could  not  be  contained,  and  I\\ncould  feel  the  mist  of  tears  in  my  eyes.  Then,  Jallaluddin\\nsaid, “Azad, we have always loved you, and we believe in\\nyou.  We  shall  always  be  proud  of  you”.  The  intensity  and\\npurity  of  their  faith  in  my  capabilities  broke  my  last\\ndefences, and tears welled up in my eyes.\\n* * *\\n\\n\\x0cII\\n\\n\\x0cCREATION\\n\\n[ 1963 – 1980 ]\\n\\n\\x0c4\\n\\n\\x0cAchievers\\n\\nI\\n\\nstarted  my  work  at  NASA  at  the  Langley  Research\\nCentre  (LRC)  in  Hampton,  Virginia.  This  is  primarily  an\\nR&D  centre  for  advanced  aerospace  technology.  One  of\\nmy most vivid memories\\n\\nof LRC is of a piece of sculpture depicting a charioteer\\ndriving  two  horses,  one  representing  scientific  research\\nand  the  other  technological  development,  metaphorically\\nencapsulating  the  interconnection  between  research  and\\ndevelopment.\\n\\nIt  operates  NASA’s \\n\\nFrom LRC I went to the Goddard Space Flight Centre\\n(GSFC) at Greenbelt, Maryland. This Centre develops and\\nmanages  most  of  NASA’s  earth-orbiting  science  and\\napplications  satellites. \\ntracking\\nnetworks  for  all  space  missions.  Towards  the  end  of  my\\nvisit, I went to the Wallops Flight Facility at Wallops Island in\\nEast Coast, Virginia. This place was the base for NASA’s\\nsounding  rocket  programme.  Here,  I  saw  a  painting\\nprominently displayed in the reception lobby. It depicted a\\nbattle scene with a few rockets flying in the background. A\\npainting with this theme should be the most commonplace\\nthing  at  a  Flight  Facility,  but  the  painting  caught  my  eye\\nbecause  the  soldiers  on  the  side  launching  the  rockets\\nwere not white, but dark-skinned, with the racial features of\\npeople found in South Asia. One day, my curiosity got the\\nbetter of me, drawing me towards the painting. It turned out\\nto  be  Tipu  Sultan’s  army  fighting  the  British.  The  painting\\ndepicted  a  fact  forgotten  in  Tipu’s  own  country  but\\ncommemorated here on the other side of the planet. I was\\nhappy  to  see  an  Indian  glorified  by  NASA  as  a  hero  of\\nwarfare rocketry.\\n\\nMy \\n\\nimpression  of \\n\\nthe  American  people  can  be\\nsummarized by a quotation from Benjamin Franklin, “Those\\nthings that hurt instruct!” I realised that people in this part of\\nthe world meet their problems head on. They attempt to get\\nout of them rather than suffer them.\\n\\nMy mother had once narrated an incident from the Holy\\nBook—  after  God  created  man,  he  asked  the  angels  to\\nprostrate  themselves  before Adam.  Everybody  prostrated\\nthemselves  except  Iblis,  or  Satan,  who  refused.  “Why  did\\nyou not prostrate yourself?” Allah asked. “You created me\\nof fire and him of clay. Does not that make me nobler than\\nAdam?”  Satan  contended.  God  said,  “Be  gone  from\\nparadise!  This  is  no  place  for  your  contemptuous  pride.”\\nSatan obeyed, but not before cursing Adam with the same\\nfate. Soon Adam followed suit by becoming a transgressor\\nafter eating the forbidden fruit. Allah said, “Go hence and\\nmay your descendants live a life of doubt and mistrust.”\\n\\nWhat  makes  life  in  Indian  organizations  difficult  is  the\\nwidespread prevalence of this very contemptuous pride. It\\nstops  us  from  listening  to  our  juniors,  subordinates  and\\npeople down the line. You cannot expect a person to deliver\\nresults if you humiliate him, nor can you expect him to be\\ncreative if you abuse him or despise him. The line between\\nfirmness  and  harshness,  between  strong  leadership  and\\nbullying, between discipline and vindictiveness is very fine,\\nbut  it  has  to  be  drawn.  Unfortunately,  the  only  line\\nprominently  drawn  in  our  country  today  is  between  the\\n‘heroes’  and  the  ‘zeros’.  On  one  side  are  a  few  hundred\\n‘heroes’ keeping nine hundred and fifty million people down\\non the other side. This situation has to be changed.\\n\\nAs  the  process  of  confronting  and  solving  problems\\noften  requires  hard  work  and  is  painful,  we  have  endless\\n\\n\\x0cprocrastination. Actually, problems can be the cutting edge\\nthat actually distinguish between success and failure. They\\ndraw out innate courage and wisdom.\\n\\nAs  soon  as  I  returned  from  NASA,  India’s  first  rocket\\nlaunch took place on 21 November 1963. It was a sounding\\nrocket, called NikeApache, made at NASA. The rocket was\\nassembled in the church building I have referred to earlier.\\nThe only equipment available to transport the rocket was a\\ntruck  and  a  manually  operated  hydraulic  crane.  The\\nassembled  rocket  was  to  be  shifted  from  the  church\\nbuilding  to  the  launch  pad  by  truck.  When  the  rocket  was\\nlifted  by  the  crane  and  was  about  to  be  placed  on  the\\nlauncher, it started tilting, indicating a leak in the hydraulic\\nsystem  of  the  crane.  As  we  were  fast  approaching  the\\nlaunch time, 6 p.m., any repairs to the crane had to be ruled\\nout. Fortunately, the leak was not large and we managed to\\nlift  the  rocket  manually,  using  our  collective  muscle  power\\nand finally placing it on the launcher.\\n\\nIn  the  maiden  Nike-Apache  launch,  I  was  in  charge  of\\nrocket  integration  and  safety.  Two  of  my  colleagues  who\\nplayed a very active and crucial role in this launch were D\\nEaswardas and R Aravamudan. Easwardas undertook the\\nrocket  assembly  and  arranged  the  launch.  Aravamudan,\\nwhom we called Dan, was in charge of radar, telemetry and\\nground support. The launch was smooth and problemfree.\\nWe obtained excellent flight data and returned with a sense\\nof pride and accomplishment.\\n\\nWhen we were relaxing the next evening at the dinner\\ntable, we received news of the assassination of President\\nJohn F Kennedy in Dallas, Texas. We were appalled. The\\nKennedy  years  were  a  significant  era  in  America,  when\\nyoung men were at the helm of affairs. I used to read with\\ninterest about Kennedy’s moves in the missile crisis of late\\n1962.  The  Soviet  Union  built  missile  sites  in  Cuba,  from\\nwhich  it  would  have  been  possible  to  launch  attacks  on\\nimposed  a  blockade  or\\nAmerican  cities.  Kennedy \\n‘quarantine’,  barring  the  introduction  of  any  offensive\\nmissiles  to  Cuba. America  also  threatened  to  respond  to\\nany Soviet nuclear attack from Cuba on any country in the\\nWestern Hemisphere by retaliating against the USSR. After\\nfourteen days of intense drama, the crisis was resolved by\\nthe  Soviet  Premier  Khrushchev  ordering  that  the  Cuban\\nbases be dismantled and the missiles returned to Russia.\\n\\nThe next day, Prof. Sarabhai had a detailed discussion\\nwith us on future plans. He was creating a new frontier in\\nthe  field  of  science  and  technology  in  India.  A  new\\ngeneration, scientists and engineers in their 30s and early\\n40s, was being charged with an unprecedented dynamism.\\nOur  biggest  qualifications  at  INCOSPAR  were  not  our\\ndegrees  and  training,  but  Prof.  Sarabhai’s  faith  in  our\\ncapabilities. After the successful launch of Nike-Apache, he\\nchose  to  share  with  us  his  dream  of  an  Indian  Satellite\\nLaunch Vehicle.\\n\\nProf.  Sarabhai’s  optimism  was  highly  contagious.  The\\nvery news of his coming to Thumba would electrify people\\nand  all  laboratories,  workshops  and  design  offices  would\\nhum  with  unceasing  activity.  People  would  work  virtually\\nround the clock because of their enthusiasm to show Prof.\\nSarabhai  something  new,  something  that  had  not  been\\ndone before in our country—be it a new design or a new\\nmethod  of \\nfabrication  or  even  an  out-of-the-way\\nadministrative  procedure.  Prof.  Sarabhai  would  often\\nassign multiple tasks to a single person or a group. Though\\nsome of those tasks would appear totally unrelated in the\\nbeginning, they would, at a later stage, emerge as deeply\\ninterconnected.  When  Prof.  Sarabhai  was  talking  to  us\\n\\n\\x0cabout  the  Satellite  Launch  Vehicle  (SLV),  he  asked  me,\\nalmost  in  the  same  breath,  to  take  up  studies  on  a\\nrocketassisted take-off system (RATO) for military aircraft.\\nThe  two  things  had  no  apparent  connection  except  in  the\\nmind of this great visionary. I knew that all I had to do was to\\nremain alert and focussed on my purpose, and sooner or\\nlater, an opportunity to do a challenging job would enter my\\nlaboratory.\\n\\nto \\n\\nProf.  Sarabhai  was  ever-willing \\n\\ntry  out  novel\\napproaches and liked to draw in young people. He had the\\nwisdom  and  judgement  which  enabled  him  to  realise  not\\nonly if something was well done, but also when it was time\\nto stop. In my opinion, he was an ideal experimenter and\\ninnovator.  When  there  were  alternative  courses  of  action\\nbefore  us,  whose  outcome  was  difficult  to  predict,  or  to\\nreconcile varying perspectives, Prof. Sarabhai would resort\\nto experimentation to resolve the issue. This was precisely\\nthe  situation  at  INCOSPAR  in  1963.  A  bunch  of  young,\\ninexperienced, but nevertheless energetic and enthusiastic\\npersons  were  given  the  task  of  fleshing  out  the  spirit  of\\nselfreliance  in  the  field  of  science  and  technology  in\\ngeneral, and of space research in particular. It was a great\\nexample of leadership by trust.\\n\\nThe rocket launch site later blossomed into the Thumba\\nEquatorial  Rocket  Launch  Station  (TERLS).  TERLS  was\\nestablished through active collaboration with France, USA\\nand USSR. The leader of the Indian space programme—\\nProf.  Vikram  Sarabhai—had  comprehended \\nfull\\nimplications of the challenge and had not balked at taking it\\non.  Right  from  the  day  INCOSPAR  was  formed,  he  was\\naware of the need to organize an integrated national space\\nprogramme,  with  the  equipment  for  the  manufacture  of\\nrockets  and  launch  facilities  developed  and  produced\\nindigenously.\\n\\nthe \\n\\nfabrication \\n\\ntechniques, \\n\\nWith  this  in  view,  a  wide-ranging  programme  for\\nscientific  and  technological  development  in  rocket  fuels,\\npropulsion  systems,  aeronautics,  aerospace  materials,\\nadvanced \\nrocket  motor\\ninstrumentation,  control  and  guidance  systems,  telemetry,\\ntracking \\nfor\\nexperimentation  in  space  were  launched  at  the  Space\\nScience  and  Technology  Centre  and \\nthe  Physical\\nResearch  Laboratory  at  Ahmedabad.  Incidentally,  this\\nlaboratory  has  produced  a  large  number  of  Indian  space\\nscientists of extremely high calibre over the years.\\n\\ninstruments \\n\\nscientific \\n\\nsystems \\n\\nand \\n\\nThe  real  journey  of  the  Indian  aerospace  programme,\\nhowever,  had  begun  with  the  Rohini  Sounding  Rocket\\n(RSR) Programme. What is it that distinguishes a sounding\\nrocket  from  a  Satellite  Launch  Vehicle  (SLV)  and  from  a\\nmissile?  In  fact,  they  are  three  different  kinds  of  rockets.\\nSounding rockets are normally used for probing the near-\\nearth  environment,  including  the  upper  regions  of  the\\natmosphere.  While  they  can  carry  a  variety  of  scientific\\npayloads to a range of altitudes, they cannot impart the final\\nvelocity needed to orbit the payload. On the other hand, a\\nlaunch  vehicle \\ninto  orbit  a\\ntechnological  payload  or  satellite.  The  final  stage  of  a\\nlaunch vehicle provides the necessary velocity for a satellite\\nto enter an orbit. This is a complex operation requiring on-\\nboard  guidance  and  control  systems.  A  missile,  though\\nbelonging  to  the  same  family,  is  a  still  more  complex\\nsystem.  In  addition  to  the  large  terminal  velocity  and\\nonboard guidance and control, it must have the capability to\\nhome onto targets. When the targets are fast-moving and\\ncapable of manoeuvring, a missile is also required to carry\\n\\nis  designed \\n\\ninject \\n\\nto \\n\\n\\x0cout target-tracking functions.\\n\\nfor \\n\\nresponsible \\n\\nThe  RSR  programme  was \\n\\nthe\\ndevelopment and fabrication of sounding rockets and their\\nassociated on-board systems for scientific investigations in\\nIndia.  Under  this  programme,  a  family  of  operational\\nsounding rockets were developed. These rockets had wide\\nranging capabilities, and to date several hundreds of these\\nrockets  have  been  launched  for  various  scientific  and\\ntechnological studies.\\n\\nI still remember that the first Rohini rocket consisted of a\\nsingle  solid  propulsion  motor  weighing  a  mere  32  kg.  It\\nlifted a nominal 7 kg payload to an altitude of about 10 km.\\nIt  was  soon  followed  by  another,  to  which  one  more  solid\\npropellant  stage  was  added  to  dispatch  multi-experiment\\npayloads weighing nearly 100 kg to an altitude of over 350\\nkm.\\n\\nThe development of these rockets had resulted in a fully\\nindigenous capability in the production of sounding rockets\\nas  well  as  their  propellants.  This  programme  had  brought\\ninto the country technology for the production of very high-\\nperformance  solid  propellants, \\nthose  based  on\\npolyurethane and polybutane polymer. It later resulted in the\\nsetting  up  of  a  Propellant  Fuel  Complex  (PFC)  to\\nmanufacture  strategic  chemicals  required \\nfor  rocket\\nengines, and a Rocket Propellant Plant (RPP) to produce\\npropellants.\\n\\nlike \\n\\nThe  development  of  Indian  rockets  in  the  twentieth\\ncentury can be seen as a revival of the eighteenth century\\ndream  of  Tipu  Sultan.  When  Tipu  Sultan  was  killed,  the\\nBritish captured more than 700 rockets and subsystems of\\n900  rockets  in  the  battle  of  Turukhanahally  in  1799.  His\\narmy had 27 brigades, called Kushoons, and each brigade\\nhad  a  company  of  rocket  men,  called  Jourks.  These\\nrockets  had  been  taken  to  England  by  William  Congreve\\nand were subjected by the British to what we call ‘reverse\\nengineering’  today.  There  were,  of  course,  no  GATT,  IPR\\nAct,  or  patent  regime.  With  the  death  of  Tipu,  Indian\\nrocketry also met its demise—at least for 150 years.\\n\\nMeanwhile,  rocket  technology  made  great  strides\\nabroad.  Konstantin  Tsiolkovsky  in  Russia  (1903),  Robert\\nGoddard in USA (1914) and Hermann Oberth in Germany\\n(1923)  gave  rocketry  new  dimensions.  In  Nazi  Germany,\\nWernher  von  Braun’s  group  produced  V-2  short  range\\nballistic  missiles  and  showered  fire  on  the Allied  Forces.\\nAfter the war, both the USA and the USSR captured their\\nshare of German rocket technology and rocket engineers.\\nWith this booty, they started to run their deadly arms race\\nwith missiles and warheads.\\n\\nRocketry was reborn in India thanks to the technological\\nvision of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Prof. Sarabhai\\ntook  the  challenge  of  giving  physical  dimensions  to  this\\ndream.  Very  many \\nindividuals  with  myopic  vision\\nquestioned  the  relevance  of  space  activities  in  a  newly\\nindependent nation which was finding it difficult to feed its\\npopulation.  But  neither  Prime  Minister  Nehru  nor  Prof.\\nSarabhai  had  any  ambiguity  of  purpose.  Their  vision  was\\nvery clear: if Indians were to play a meaningful role in the\\ncommunity of nations, they must be second to none in the\\napplication  of  advanced  technologies  to  their  real-life\\nproblems.  They  had  no  intention  of  using  it  merely  as  a\\nmeans to display our might.\\n* * *\\n\\n\\x0c5\\n\\n\\x0cDreamers\\n\\nD\\n\\nuring  his  frequent  visits  to  Thumba,  Prof.  Sarabhai\\nwould  openly  review  the  progress  of  work  with  the  entire\\nteam.  He  never  gave  directions.  Rather,  through  a  free\\nexchange\\n\\nof views, he led us forward into new terrain which often\\nrevealed  an  unforeseen  solution.  Perhaps  he  was  aware\\nthat though a particular goal might be clear to himself, and\\nhe could give adequate directions for its accomplishment,\\nhis team members might have resisted working towards a\\ngoal  that  made  no  sense  to  them.  He  considered  the\\ncollective  understanding  of  the  problem  the  main  attribute\\nof effective leadership. He once told me, “Look, my job is to\\nmake decisions; but it is equally important to see to it that\\nthese decisions are accepted by my team members.”\\n\\nIn  fact,  Prof.  Sarabhai  took  a  series  of  decisions  that\\nwere to become the life-mission of many. We would make\\nour own rockets, our own Satellite Launch Vehicles (SLVs)\\nand our own satellites. And this would not be done one-by-\\none but concurrently, in a multi-dimensional fashion. In the\\ndevelopment of payloads for the sounding rockets, instead\\nof  getting  a  certain  payload  and  then  engineering  it  to  fit\\ninto  the  rocket,  we  discussed  the  matter  threadbare  with\\nthe  payload  scientists  working  in  different  organ-izations\\nand  at  different  locations.  I  may  even  say  that  the  most\\nsignificant achievement of the sounding rocket programme\\nwas to establish and maintain nation-wide mutual trust.\\n\\nPerhaps realising that I preferred to persuade people to\\ndo as they were told rather than use my legitimate authority,\\nProf. Sarabhai assigned me the task of providing interface\\nsupport \\nto  payload  scientists.  Almost  all  physical\\nlaboratories  in  India  were  involved  in  the  sounding  rocket\\nprogramme, each having its own mission, its own objective\\nand its own payload. These payloads were required to be\\nintegrated  to  the  rocket  structure  so  as  to  ensure  their\\nproper  functioning  and  endurance  under  flight  conditions.\\nWe had X-ray payloads to look at stars; payloads fitted with\\nradio  frequency  mass  spectrometers  to  analyse  the  gas\\ncomposition of the upper atmosphere; sodium payloads to\\nfind out wind conditions, its direction and velocity. We also\\nhad ionospheric payloads to explore different layers of the\\natmosphere.  I  not  only  had  to  interact  with  scientists  from\\nTIFR,  National  Physical  Laboratory  (NPL),  and  Physical\\nResearch  Laboratory  (PRL),  but  also  with  payload\\nscientists from USA, USSR, France, Germany and Japan.\\n\\nI often read Khalil Gibran, and always find his words full\\nof wisdom. “Bread baked without love is a bitter bread that\\nfeeds  but  half  a  man’s  hunger,”—those  who  cannot  work\\nwith their hearts achieve but a hollow, half-hearted success\\nthat  breeds  bitterness  all  around.  If  you  are  a  writer  who\\nwould secretly prefer to be a lawyer or a doctor, your written\\nwords  will  feed  but  half  the  hunger  of  your  readers;  if  you\\nare  a  teacher  who  would  rather  be  a  businessman,  your\\ninstructions  will  meet  but  half  the  need  for  knowledge  of\\nyour students; if you are a scientist who hates science, your\\nperformance will satisfy but half the needs of your mission.\\nThe  personal  unhappiness  and  failure  to  achieve  results\\nthat comes from being a round peg in a square hole is not,\\nby  any  means,  new.  But  there  are  exceptions  to  this  like\\nProf. Oda and Sudhakar, who bring to their work a personal\\ntouch  of  magic  based  upon  their  individual  character,\\npersonality,  inner  motives,  and  perhaps \\nthe  dreams\\ncrystallized within their hearts. They become so emotionally\\n\\n\\x0cinvolved with their work that any dilution of the success of\\ntheir effort fills them with grief.\\n\\nthat  radiated \\n\\nProf.  Oda  was  an  X-ray  payload  scientist  from  the\\nInstitute  of  Space  and  Aeronautical  Sciences  (ISAS),\\nJapan. I remember him as a diminutive man with a towering\\nintelligence.  His\\npersonality  and  eyes \\ndedication to his work was exemplary. He would bring X-\\nray  payloads  from  ISAS,  which  along  with  the  X-ray\\npayloads made by Prof. UR Rao, would be engineered by\\nmy team to fit into the nose cone of the Rohini Rocket. At\\nan altitude of 150 km, the nose cone would be separated\\nby explosion of pyros triggered by an electronic timer. With\\nthis,  the  X-ray  sensors  would  be  exposed  to  space  for\\ncollecting  the  required  information  about  the  emissions\\nfrom  stars.  Together,  Prof.  Oda  and  Prof.  Rao  were  a\\nunique  blend  of  intellect  and  dedication,  which  one  rarely\\nsees. One day, when I was working on the integration for\\nProf. Oda’s payload with my timer devices, he insisted on\\nusing  the  timers  he  had  brought  from  Japan.  To  me  they\\nlooked  flimsy,  but  Prof.  Oda  stuck  to  his  stand  that  the\\nIndian timers be replaced by the Japanese ones. I yielded\\nto his suggestion and replaced the timers. The rocket took\\noff  elegantly  and  attained  the  intended  altitude.  But  the\\ntelemetry  signal  reported  mission  failure  on  account  of\\ntimer malfunction. Prof. Oda was so upset that tears welled\\nup in his eyes. I was stunned by the emotional intensity of\\nProf. Oda’s response. He had clearly put his heart and soul\\ninto his work.\\n\\nSudhakar was my colleague in the Payload Preparation\\nLaboratory. As  part  of  the  pre-launch  schedule,  we  were\\nfilling  and  remotely  pressing  the  hazardous  sodium  and\\nthermite  mix.  As  usual,  it  was  a  hot  and  humid  day  at\\nThumba.  After  the  sixth  such  operation,  Sudhakar  and  I\\nwent into the payload room to confirm the proper filling of\\nthe  mix.  Suddenly,  a  drop  of  sweat  from  his  forehead  fell\\nonto the sodium, and before we knew what was happening,\\nthere was a violent explosion which shook the room. For a\\nfew paralysed seconds, I did not know what to do. The fire\\nwas spreading, and water would not extinguish the sodium\\nfire.  Trapped  in  this  inferno,  Sudhakar,  however,  did  not\\nlose his presence of mind. He broke the glass window with\\nhis bare hands and literally threw me out to safety before\\njumping out himself. I touched Sudhakar’s bleeding hands\\nin  gratitude,  he  was  smiling  through  his  pain.  Sudhakar\\nspent  many  weeks  in  the  hospital  recuperating  from  the\\nsevere burns he had received.\\n\\nAt  TERLS,  I  was  involved  with  rocket  preparation\\nactivities,  payload  assembly, \\ntesting  and  evaluation\\nbesides  building  subsystems  like  payload  housing  and\\njettisonable nose cones. Working with the nose cones led\\nme, as a natural consequence, into the field of composite\\nmaterials.\\n\\nIt  is  interesting  to  know  that  the  bows  found,  during\\narchaeological excavations at different sites in the country,\\nreveal  that  Indians  used  composite  bows  made  of  wood,\\nsinew,  and  horn  as  early  as  the  eleventh  century,  at  least\\n500  years  before  such  bows  were  made  in  medieval\\nEurope. The versatility of composites, in the sense that they\\npossess  very  desirable  structural, \\nthermal,  electrical,\\nchemical and mechanical properties, fascinated me. I was\\nso enthused with these man-made materials that I was in a\\nhurry  to  know  everything  about  them  almost  overnight.  I\\nused  to  read  up  everything  available  on  related  topics.  I\\nwas  particularly  interested  in  the  glass  and  carbon  Fibre\\nReinforced Plastic (FRP) composites.\\n\\nAn FRP composite is composed of an inorganic fibre\\n\\n\\x0cwoven  into  a  matrix  that  encloses  it  and  gives  the\\ncomponent its bulk form. In February 1969, Prime Minister\\nIndira  Gandhi  visited  Thumba  to  dedicate  TERLS  to  the\\nInternational Space Science Community. On this occasion,\\nshe  commissioned  the  country’s  first  filament  winding\\nmachine  in  our  laboratory.  This  event  brought  my  team,\\nwhich  included  CR  Satya,  PN  Subramanian  and  MN\\nSatyanara-yana, great satisfaction. We made highstrength\\nglass  cloth  laminates  to  build  non-magnetic  payload\\nhousings and flew them in two-stage sounding rockets. We\\nalso wound and test flew rocket motor casings of up to 360\\nmm diameter.\\n\\nSlowly,  but  surely,  two  Indian  rockets  were  born  at\\nThumba.  They  were  christened  Rohini  and  Menaka,  after\\nthe two mythological dancers in the court of Indra, the king\\nof  the  sky.  The  Indian  payloads  no  longer  needed  to  be\\nlaunched by French rockets. Could this have been done but\\nfor  the  atmosphere  of  trust  and  commitment  which  Prof.\\nSarabhai had created at INCOSPAR? He brought into use\\neach person’s knowledge and skills. He made every man\\nfeel directly involved in problem solving. By the very fact of\\nthe  team  members’  participation,  the  solutions  became\\ngenuine and earned the trust of the entire team resulting in\\ntotal commitment towards implementation.\\n\\nProf.  Sarabhai  was  matter-of-fact  and  never  tried  to\\nhide  his  disappointment.  He  used  to  talk  with  us  in  an\\nhonest  and  objective  manner.  Sometimes  I  found  him\\nmaking  things  look  more  positive  than  they  actually  were,\\nand  then  charming  us  by  his  almost  magical  powers  of\\npersuasion. When we were at the drawing board, he would\\nbring  someone  from  the  developed  world  for  a  technical\\ncollaboration. That was his subtle way of challenging each\\none of us to stretch our capabilities.\\n\\nAt  the  same  time,  even  if  we  failed  to  meet  certain\\nobjectives,  he  would  praise  whatever  we  had\\naccomplished.  Whenever  he  found  any  one  of  us  going\\nover  his  head  and  attempting  a  task  for  which  he  did  not\\nhave the capability or skill, Prof. Sarabhai would reassign\\nactivity in such a way so as to lower pressure and permit\\nbetter  quality  work  to  be  performed.  By  the  time  the  first\\nRohini-75  rocket  was  launched  from  TERLS  on  20\\nNovember  1967,  almost  each  one  of  us  was  in  his  own\\ngroove.\\n\\nEarly  next  year,  Prof.  Sarabhai  wanted  to  see  me\\nurgently  in  Delhi.  By  now  I  was  accustomed  to  Prof.\\nSarabhai’s  working  methods.  He  was  always  full  of\\nenthusiasm and optimism. In such a state of mind, sudden\\nflashes  of  inspiration  were  almost  natural.  On  reaching\\nDelhi,  I  contacted  Prof.  Sarabhai’s  secretary  for  an\\nappointment  and  was  asked  to  meet  him  at  3.30  a.m.  at\\nHotel Ashoka. Delhi being a slightly unfamiliar place, with\\nan unfriendly climate for someone like me, conditioned to\\nthe  warm  and  humid  climate  of  South  India,  I  decided  to\\nwait in the hotel lounge after finishing my dinner.\\n\\nI have always been a religious person in the sense that I\\nmaintain a working partnership with God. I was aware that\\nthe best work required more ability than I possessed and\\ntherefore I needed help that only God could give me. I made\\na true estimate of my own ability, then raised it by 50 per\\ncent  and  put  myself  in  God’s  hands.  In  this  partnership,  I\\nhave  always  received  all  the  power  I  needed,  and  in  fact\\nhave actually felt it flowing through me. Today, I can affirm\\nthat  the  kingdom  of  God  is  within  you  in  the  form  of  this\\npower, to help achieve your goals and realise your dreams.\\nThere are many different types and levels of experience\\n\\n\\x0cthat  turn  this  internal  power  reaction  critical.  Sometimes,\\nwhen we are ready, the gentlest of contacts with Him fills us\\nwith  insight  and  wisdom.  This  could  come  from  an\\nencounter with another person, from a word, a question, a\\ngesture  or  even  a  look.  Many  a  time,  it  could  come  even\\nthrough a book, a conversation, some phrase, even a line\\nfrom  a  poem  or  the  mere  sight  of  a  picture.  Without  the\\nslightest warning, something new breaks into your life and a\\nsecret  decision  is  taken,  a  decision  that  you  may  be\\ncompletely unconscious of, to start with.\\n\\nI looked around the elegant lounge. Somebody had left\\na book on a nearby sofa. As if to fill the small hours of that\\ncold night with some warm thoughts, I picked up the book\\nand started browsing. I must have turned only a few pages\\nof the book, about which I do not remember a thing today.\\n\\nIt  was  some  popular  book  related \\n\\nto  business\\nmanagement. I was not really reading it, only skimming over\\nparagraphs and turning pages. Suddenly, my eyes fell on a\\npassage  in  the  book,  it  was  a  quotation  from  George\\nBernard  Shaw.  The  gist  of  the  quote  was  that  all\\nreasonable men adapt themselves to the world. Only a few\\nunreasonable  ones  persist  in  trying  to  adapt  the  world  to\\nthemselves.  All  progress  in  the  world  depends  on  these\\nunreasonable  men  and \\ninnovative  and  often\\nnonconformist actions.\\n\\ntheir \\n\\nI  started  reading  the  book  from  the  Bernard  Shaw\\npassage  onwards.  The  author  was  describing  certain\\nmyths  woven  around  the  concept  and  the  process  of\\ninnovation in industry and business. I read about the myth of\\nstrategic  planning.  It  is  generally  believed  that  substantial\\nstrategic  and  technological  planning  greatly  increases  the\\nodds  of  a  ‘no  surprises’  outcome.  The  author  was  of  the\\nopinion that it is essential for a project manager to learn to\\nlive with uncertainty and ambiguity. He felt that it was a myth\\nto hold that the key to economic success is computability. A\\nquotation  from  General  George  Patton  was  given  as  a\\ncounterpoint  to  this  myth—that  a  good  plan  violently\\nexecuted  right  now  is  far  better  than  a  perfect  plan\\nexecuted next week. It is a myth that to win big one must\\nstrive to optimize, the author felt. Optimization wins only on\\npaper, but would invariably lose later in the real world, the\\nbook said.\\n\\nWaiting in the hotel lobby at 1 a.m. for an appointment\\ntwo hours later was certainly not a reasonable proposition,\\nneither  for  me  nor  for  Prof.  Sarabhai.  But  then,  Prof.\\nSarabhai  had  always  exhibited  a  strong  component  of\\nunorthodoxy in his character. He was running the show of\\nspace research in the country—under-staffed, overworked\\n— nevertheless in a successful manner.\\n\\nSuddenly,  I  became  aware  of  another  man  who  came\\nand  sat  down  on  the  sofa  opposite  mine.  He  was  a  well-\\nbuilt  person  with  an  intelligent  look  and  refined  posture.\\nUnlike me—always disorderly in my dress— this man was\\nwearing elegant clothes. Notwithstanding the odd hours, he\\nwas alert and vivacious.\\n\\nThere  was  a  strange  magnetism  about  him  which\\nderailed the train of my thoughts on innovation. And before I\\ncould  get  back  to  the  book,  I  was  informed  that  Prof.\\nSarabhai  was  ready  to  receive  me.  I  left  the  book  on  the\\nnearby sofa from where I had picked it up. I was surprised\\nwhen the man sitting on the opposite sofa was also asked\\nto  come  inside.  Who  was  he?  It  was  not  long  before  my\\nquestion  was  answered.  Even  before  we  sat  down,  Prof.\\nSarabhai  introduced  us  to  each  other.  He  was  Group\\nCaptain VS Narayanan from Air Headquarters.\\n\\nProf.  Sarabhai  ordered  coffee  for  both  of  us  and\\n\\n\\x0cunfolded his plan of developing a rocket-assisted take-off\\nsystem  (RATO)  for  military  aircraft.  This  would  help  our\\nwarplanes to take off from short runways in the Himalayas.\\nHot  coffee  was  served  over  small  talk.  It  was  totally\\nuncharacteristic  of  Prof.  Sarabhai.  But  as  soon  as  we\\nfinished  the  coffee,  Prof.  Sarabhai  rose  and  asked  us  to\\naccompany  him  to  Tilpat  Range  on  the  outskirts  of  Delhi.\\nAs  we  were  passing  through  the  lobby,  I  threw  a  cursory\\nglance at the sofa where I had left the book. It was not there.\\nIt  was  about  an  hour’s  drive  to  the  Range.  Prof.\\nSarabhai  showed  us  a  Russian  RATO.  “If  I  get  you  the\\nmotors  of  this  system  from  Russia,  could  you  do  it  in\\neighteen months time?” Prof. Sarabhai asked us. “Yes, we\\ncan!”  Both  Gp  Capt  VS  Narayanan  and  I  spoke  almost\\nsimultaneously.  Prof.  Sarabhai’s  face  beamed,  reflecting\\nour fascination. I recalled what I had read, “He will bestow\\non you a light to walk in.”\\n\\nAfter  dropping  us  back  at  the  Hotel  Ashoka,  Prof.\\nSarabhai  went  to  the  Prime  Minister’s  house  for  a\\nbreakfast meeting. By that evening, the news of India taking\\nup the indigenous development of a device to help short run\\ntake-offs by high performance military aircraft, with myself\\nheading the project, was made public. I was filled with many\\nemotions— happiness, gratitude, a sense of fulfilment and\\nthese lines from a littleknown poet of the nineteenth-century\\ncrossed my mind:\\n\\nFor all your days prepare\\n\\nAnd meet them ever alike\\nWhen you are the anvil, bear –\\nWhen you are the hammer, strike.\\n\\nRATO motors were mounted on aircraft to provide the\\nadditional  thrust  required  during  the  take-off  run  under\\ncertain adverse operating conditions like partially bombed-\\nout  runways,  high  altitude  airfields,  more \\nthe\\nprescribed  load,  or  very  high  ambient  temperatures.  The\\nAir  Force  was  in  dire  need  of  a  large  number  of  RATO\\nmotors for their S22 and HF-24 aircraft.\\n\\nthan \\n\\nThe  Russian  RATO  motor  shown  to  us  at  the  Tilpat\\nRange was capable of generating a 3000 kg thrust with a\\ntotal impulse of 24500 kgseconds. It weighed 220 kg and\\nhad  a  double  base  propellant  encased  in  steel.  The\\ndevelopment  work  was  to  be  carried  out  at  the  Space\\nScience and Technology Centre with the assistance of the\\nDefence  Research  and  Development  Organization\\n(DRDO), HAL, DTD&P(Air) and Air Headquarters.\\n\\nAfter  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  available  options,  I\\nchose a fibreglass motor casing. We decided in favour of a\\ncomposite propellant which gives a higher specific impulse\\nand aimed at a longer burning time to utilize it completely. I\\nalso  decided  to  take  additional  safety  measures  by\\nincorporating  a  diaphragm  which  would  rupture  if  the\\nchamber  pressure  for  some  reason  exceeded  twice  the\\noperating pressure. Two significant developments occurred\\nduring  the  work  on  RATO.  The  first  was  the  release  of  a\\nten-year profile for space research in the country, prepared\\nby  Prof.  Sarabhai.  This  profile  was  not  merely  an  activity\\nplan laid down by the top man for his team to comply with, it\\nwas a theme paper meant for open discussions, to be later\\ntransformed  into  a  programme.  In  fact,  I  found  it  was  the\\nromantic  manifesto  of  a  person  deeply  in  love  with  the\\nspace research programme in his country.\\n\\nThe  plan  mainly  centred  around  the  early  ideas  which\\nhad  been  born  at  INCOSPAR;  it  included  utilization  of\\nsatellites  for  television  and  developmental  education,\\nfor\\nmeteorological  observations  and  remote  sensing \\n\\n\\x0cmanagement of natural resources. To this had been added\\nthe development and launch of satellite launch vehicles.\\n\\nself-reliance  and \\n\\nThe  active  international  cooperation  dominant  in  the\\nearly  years  was  virtually  eased  out  in  this  plan  and  the\\nemphasis  was  on \\nindigenous\\ntechnologies.  The  plan  talked  about  the  realisation  of  a\\nSLV for injecting lightweight satellites into a low earth orbit,\\nupgrading  of  Indian  satellites  from  laboratory  models  to\\nspace  entities  and  development  of  a  wide  range  of\\nspacecraft  subsystems  like  the  apogee  and  booster\\nmotors,  momentum  wheel,  and  solar  panel  deployment\\nmechanism. It also promised a wide range of technological\\nspin-offs  like  the  gyros,  various  types  of  transducers,\\ntelemetry,  adhesives,  and  polymers \\nfor  non-space\\napplications. Over and above, there was the dream of an\\nadequate infrastructure that would be capable of supporting\\nR&D in a variety of engineering and scientific disciplines.\\n\\nThe second development was the formation of a Missile\\nPanel  in  the  Ministry  of  Defence.  Both  Narayanan  and  I\\nwere inducted as members. The idea of making missiles in\\nour own country was exciting, and we spent hours on end\\nstudying the missiles of various advanced countries.\\n\\nThe  distinction  between  a  tactical  missile  and  a\\nstrategic  missile  is  often  a  fine  one.  Generally,  by\\n‘strategic’, it is understood that the missile will fly thousands\\nof  kilometres.  However,  in  warfare,  this  term  is  used  to\\ndenote  the  kind  of  target  rather  than  its  distance  from\\nmissile  launch.  Strategic  missiles  are  those  that  strike  at\\nthe  enemy’s  heartland,  either  in  counter-force  attacks  on\\ntheir  strategic  forces  or  in  counter-value  attacks  on  the\\nsociety,  which  in  essence  means  his  cities.  Tactical\\nweapons  are  those  that  influence  a  battle,  and  the  battle\\nmay  be  by  land,  sea  or  air,  or  on  all  three  together.  This\\ncategorization  now  appears  nonsensical,  as  the  US  Air\\nForce’s  ground-launched  Tomahawk  is  used  in  a  tactical\\nrole, notwithstanding its range of some 3000 km. In those\\ndays,  however,  strategic  missiles  were  synonymous  with\\nintermediate range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) with ranges in\\nthe  order  of  1500  nautical  miles  or  2780  km  and  inter-\\ncontinental  ballistic  missiles  (ICBMs)  with  a  capability  of\\ngoing even further.\\n\\nGp  Capt  Narayanan  had  an  ineffable  enthusiasm  for\\nindigenous guided missiles. He was a great admirer of the\\nstrong arm approach of the Russian Missile Development\\nProgramme.  “When  it  could  be  done  there,  why  not  here,\\nwhere space research has already prepared the soil for a\\nbonanza of missile technology?” Narayanan used to needle\\nme.\\n\\nThe  bitter  lessons  of  the  two  wars  in  1962  and  1965\\nhad left the Indian leadership with little choice in the matter\\nof achieving self-reliance in military hardware and weapon\\nsystems. A large number of Surfaceto-Air Missiles (SAMs)\\nwere obtained from the USSR to guard strategic locations.\\nGp  Capt  Narayanan  passionately  advocated \\nthe\\ndevelopment of these missiles in the country.\\n\\nWhile  working  together  on  RATO  motors  and  on  the\\nMissile Panel, Narayanan and I played the roles of student\\nand  teacher  interchangeably  wherever  required.  He  was\\nvery eager to learn about rocketry and I was very curious to\\nknow  about  airborne  weapon  systems.  The  depth  of\\nNarayanan’s  conviction  and  his  force  of  application  were\\ninspiring.  Right  from  the  day  of  our  pre-dawn  visit  to  the\\nTilpat  Range  with  Prof.  Sarabhai,  Narayanan  was  always\\nbusy with his RATO motor. He had arranged everything that\\nwas required before being asked. He obtained funding of\\nRs  75  lakhs  with  a  further  commitment  towards  any\\n\\n\\x0cunforeseen costs. “You name the thing and I will get it for\\nyou,  but  do  not  ask  for  time,”  he  said.  At  times,  I  often\\nlaughed  at  his  impatience,  and  read  for  him  these  lines\\nfrom T.S. Eliot’s Hollow Men:\\nBetween the conception\\n\\nAnd the creation\\nBetween the emotion\\nAnd the response\\nFalls the Shadow.\\n\\nDefence  R&D  at  that  time  was  heavily  dependent  on\\nimported  equipment.  Virtually  nothing  indigenous  was\\navailable.  Together,  we  made  a  long  shopping  list  and\\ndrew up an import plan. But this made me unhappy—was\\nthere no remedy or alternative? Was this nation doomed to\\nlive with screwdriver technology? Could a poor country like\\nIndia afford this kind of development?\\n\\nOne  day,  while  working  late  in  the  office,  which  was\\nquite  routine  after  I  took  up  the  RATO  projects,  I  saw  a\\nyoung  colleague,  Jaya  Chandra  Babu  going  home.  Babu\\nhad joined us a few months ago and the only thing I knew\\nabout him was that he had a very positive attitude and was\\narticulate. I called him into my office and did a bit of loud\\nthinking. “Do you have any suggestions?” I then asked him.\\nBabu remained silent for a while, and then asked for time\\nuntil  the  next  evening  to  do  some  homework  before\\nanswering my question.\\n\\nThe  next  evening,  Babu  came  to  me  before  the\\nappointed time. His face was beaming with promise. “We\\ncan  do  it,  sir!  The  RATO  system  can  be  made  without\\nimports.  The  only  hurdle  is  the  inherent  inelasticity  in  the\\napproach  of  the  organization  towards  procurement  and\\nsubcontracting, which would be the two major thrust areas\\nto  avoid  imports.”  He  gave  me  seven  points,  or,  rather,\\nasked  for  seven  liberties—financial  approval  by  a  single\\nperson  instead  of  an  entire  hierarchy,  air  travel  for  all\\npeople  on  work \\ntheir  entitlement,\\nirrespective  of \\naccountability  to  only  one  person,  lifting  of  goods  by  air-\\ncargo,  sub-contracting  to  the  private  sector,  placement  of\\norders  on \\ntechnical  competence,  and\\nexpeditious accounting procedures.\\n\\nthe  basis  of \\n\\nThese  demands  were  unheard  of \\n\\nin  government\\nestablishments, which tend to be conservative, yet I could\\nsee  the  soundness  of  his  proposition.  The  RATO  project\\nwas a new game and there was nothing wrong if it was to\\nbe played with a new set of rules. I weighed all the pros and\\ncons  of  Babu’s  suggestions  for  a  whole  night  and  finally\\ndecided  to  present  them  to  Prof.  Sarabhai.  Hearing  my\\nplea for administrative liberalization and seeing the merits\\nbehind it, Prof. Sarabhai approved the proposals without a\\nsecond thought.\\n\\nThrough  his  suggestions,  Babu  had  highlighted  the\\nimportance  of  business  acumen  in  developmental  work\\nwith  high  stakes.  To  make  things  move  faster  within\\nexisting  work  parameters,  you  have  to  pump  in  more\\npeople, more material and more money. If you can’t do that,\\nchange  your  parameters!  Instinctive  businessman  that  he\\nwas,  Babu  did  not  remain  long  with  us  and  left  ISRO  for\\ngreener  pastures  in  Nigeria.  I  could  never  forget  Babu’s\\ncommon sense in financial matters.\\n\\nWe had opted for a composite structure for the RATO\\nmotor casing using filament fibre glass/epoxy. We had also\\ngone  in  for  a  high  energy  composite  propellant  and  an\\nevent-based ignition and jettisoning system in real-time. A\\ncanted nozzle was designed to deflect the jet away from the\\naircraft.  We  conducted  the  first  static  test  of  RATO  in  the\\n\\n\\x0ctwelfth  month  of  the  project  initiation.  Within  the  next  four\\nmonths,  we  conducted  64  static  tests. And  we  were  just\\nabout 20 engineers working on the project!\\n* * *\\n\\n\\x0c6\\n\\n\\x0cMovers\\n\\nThe future satellite launch vehicle (SLV) had also been\\nconceived  by  this  time.  Recognising  the  immense  socio-\\neconomic  benefits  of  space  technology,  Prof.  Sarabhai\\ndecided  in  1969,  to  go  full-steam  ahead  with  the  task  of\\nestablishing indigenous capability in building and launching\\nour  own  satellites.  He  personally  participated  in  an  aerial\\nsurvey  of  the  east  coast  for  a  possible  site  for  launching\\nsatellite launch vehicles and large rockets.\\n\\nProf. Sarabhai was concentrating on the east coast in\\norder  to  let  the  launch  vehicle  take  full  advantage  of  the\\nearth’s  west  to  east  rotation.  He  finally  selected  the\\nSriharikota island, 100 km north of Madras (now Chennai),\\nand thus the SHAR Rocket Launch Station was born. The\\ncrescent-shaped island has a maximum width of 8 km and\\nlies alongside the coastline. The island is as big as Madras\\ncity.  The  Buckingham  Canal  and  the  Pulicat  lake  form  its\\nwestern boundary.\\n\\nIn  1968,  we  had  formed  the  Indian  Rocket  Society.\\nSoon  after,  the  INCOSPAR  was  reconstituted  as  an\\nadvisory body under the Indian National Science Academy\\n(INSA)  and  the  Indian  Space  Research  Organization\\n(ISRO)  was  created  under  the  Department  of  Atomic\\nEnergy (DAE) to conduct space research in the country.\\n\\nBy this time, Prof. Sarabhai had already hand-picked a\\nteam to give form to his dream of an Indian SLV. I consider\\nmyself  fortunate  to  have  been  chosen  to  be  a  project\\nleader.  Prof.  Sarabhai  gave  me \\nthe  additional\\nresponsibility of designing the fourth stage of the SLV. Dr\\nVR  Gowarikar,  MR  Kurup  and  AE  Muthunayagam  were\\ngiven the tasks of designing the other three stages.\\n\\nWhat  made  Prof.  Sarabhai  pick  a  few  of  us  for  this\\ngreat mission? One reason seemed to be our professional\\nbackground. Dr Gowarikar was doing outstanding work in\\nfield  of  composite  propellants.  MR  Kurup  had\\nthe \\nestablished  an  excellent \\nfor  propellants,\\npropulsion  and  pyrotechnics.  Muthunayagam  had  proved\\nhimself  in  the  field  of  high  energy  propellants.  The  fourth\\nstage  was  to  be  a  composite  structure  and  called  for  a\\nlarge  number  of  innovations  in  fabrication  technology;\\nperhaps that was why I was brought in.\\n\\nlaboratory \\n\\nI laid the foundation for Stage IV on two rocks—sensible\\napproximation  and  unawed  support. \\nI  have  always\\nconsidered the price of perfection prohibitive and allowed\\nmistakes as a part of the learning process. I prefer a dash\\nof  daring  and  persistence  to  perfection.  I  have  always\\nsupported  learning  on  the  part  of  my  team  members  by\\npaying vigilant attention to each of their attempts, be they\\nsuccessful or unsuccessful.\\n\\nIn my group, progress was recognized and reinforced at\\nevery  tiny  step.  Although  I  provided  access  to  all  the\\ninformation that my co-workers in Stage IV needed, I found I\\ncould not spend enough time to be a useful facilitator and a\\nsource  of  support.  I  wondered  if  there  was  something\\nwrong  with  the  way  in  which  I  managed  my  time. At  this\\nstage, Prof. Sarabhai brought a French visitor to our work\\ncentre to point out the problem to me. This gentleman was\\nProf.  Curien,  President  of  CNES  (Centre  Nationale  de\\nEtudes  Spatiales),  our  counterpart  in  France.  They  were\\nthen developing the Diamont launch vehicles. Prof. Curien\\nwas a thorough professional. Together, Prof. Sarabhai and\\nProf. Curien helped me set a target. While they discussed\\nthe means by which I could reach it, they also cautioned me\\nabout the possibilities of failure. While I arrived at a better\\n\\n\\x0cawareness  of  Stage  IV  problems  through  the  supportive\\ncounselling  of  Prof.  Curien,  Prof.  Sarabhai’s  catalytic\\nintervention led Prof. Curien to reinterpret his own progress\\nin the Diamont programme.\\n\\nProf. Curien advised Prof. Sarabhai to relieve me of all\\nthe minor jobs which posed little challenge and to give me\\nmore opportunities for achievement. He was so impressed\\nby  our  well-planned  efforts  that  he  inquired  if  we  could\\nmake the Diamont’s fourth stage. I recall how this brought a\\nsubtle smile to Prof. Sarabhai’s face.\\n\\nAs  a  matter  of  fact,  the  Diamont  and  SLV  airframes\\nwere incompatible. The diameters were quite different and\\nto attain interchangeability, some radical innovations were\\nrequired. I wondered where I should start. I decided to look\\naround for solutions among my own colleagues. I used to\\ncarefully observe my colleagues to see if their daily routine\\nreflected their desire to constantly experiment. I also started\\nasking  and  listening  to  anyone  who  showed  the  slightest\\npromise. Some of my friends cautioned me about what they\\ntermed as my naivete. I made it an unfailing routine to make\\nnotes  on  individual  suggestions  and  gave  handwritten\\nnotes to colleagues in engineering and design, requesting\\nconcrete follow-up action within five or ten days.\\n\\nThis  method  worked  wonderfully  well.  Prof.  Curien\\ntestified,  while  reviewing  our  progress,  that  we  had\\nachieved in a year’s time what our counterparts in Europe\\ncould  barely  manage  in  three  years.  Our  plus  point,  he\\nnoted,  was  that  each  of  us  worked  with  those  below  and\\nabove in the hierarchy. I made it a point to have the team\\nmeet at least once every week. Though it took up time and\\nenergy, I considered it essential.\\n\\nHow good is a leader? No better than his people and\\ntheir  commitment  and  participation  in  the  project  as  full\\npartners!  The  fact  that  I  got  them  all  together  to  share\\nwhatever  little  development  had  been  achieved—  results,\\nexperiences,  small  successes,  and  the  like—seemed  to\\nme worth putting all my energy and time into. It was a very\\nsmall  price  to  pay  for  that  commitment  and  sense  of\\nteamwork, which could in fact be called trust. Within my own\\nsmall  group  of  people  I  found  leaders,  and  learned  that\\nleaders  exist  at  every  level.  This  was  another  important\\naspect of management that I learned.\\n\\nthe  Diamont  airframe. \\n\\nWe had modified the existing SLV-IV Stage design to\\nsuit \\nIt  was  reconfigured  and\\nupgraded from a 250 kg, 400 mm diameter stage to a 600\\nkg, 650 mm diameter stage. After two years’ effort, when\\nwe were about to deliver it to CNES, the French suddenly\\ncancelled their Diamont BC programme. They told us that\\nthey  did  not  need  our  Stage  IV  anymore.  It  was  a  great\\nshock,  making  me  re-live  the  earlier  disappointments  at\\nDehra Dun, when I failed to get into the Air Force, and at\\nBangalore, when the Nandi project was aborted at ADE.\\n\\nlong \\n\\nit  did  not \\n\\nI had invested great hope and effort in the fourth stage,\\nso that it could be flown with a Diamont rocket. The other\\nthree stages of SLV, involving enormous work in the area\\nof  rocket  propulsion  were  at  least  five  years  away.\\nHowever, \\nthe\\ntake  me \\ndisappointment  of  Diamont  BC  Stage  IV. After  all,  I  had\\nthoroughly  enjoyed  working  on  this  project.  In  time,  RATO\\nfilled the vacuum created in me by the Diamont BC Stage.\\nWhen the RATO project was underway, the SLV project\\nslowly  started  taking  shape.  Competence  for  all  major\\nsystems  of  a  launch  vehicle  had  been  established  in\\nThumba by now. Through their outstanding efforts, Vasant\\nGowarikar,  MR  Kurup  and  Muthunayagam  prepared\\nTERLS for a big leap in rocketry.\\n\\nto  shelve \\n\\n\\x0cfor \\n\\nProf.  Sarabhai  was  an  exemplar  in  the  art  of  team-\\nbuilding. On one occasion, he had to identify a person who\\nfor  developing  a\\ncould  be  given \\nthe  responsibility \\ntelecommand  system \\nthe  SLV.  Two  men  were\\ncompetent  to  carry  out  this  task—one  was  the  seasoned\\nand  sophisticated  UR  Rao  and  the  other  was  a  relatively\\nunknown  experimenter,  G  Madhavan  Nair. Although  I  was\\ndeeply  impressed  by  Madhavan  Nair’s  dedication  and\\nabilities,  I  did  not  rate  his  chances  as  very  good.  During\\none of Prof. Sarabhai’s routine visits, Madhavan Nair boldly\\ndemonstrated  his \\nreliable\\ntelecommand  system.  Prof.  Sarabhai  did  not  take  much\\ntime  to  back  the  young  experimenter  in  preference  to  an\\nestablished expert. Madhavan Nair not only lived up to the\\nexpectations of his leader but even went beyond them. He\\nwas  to  later  become  the  project  director  of  the  Polar\\nSatellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV).\\n\\nimprovised  but  highly \\n\\nSLVs and missiles can be called first cousins: they are\\ndifferent in concept and purpose, but come from the same\\nbloodline  of  rocketry.  A  massive  missile  development\\nproject  had  been  taken  up  by  DRDO  at  the  Defence\\nResearch & Development Laboratory (DRDL), Hyderabad.\\nAs  the  pace  of  this  surface-to-air  missile  development\\nproject  increased,  the  frequency  of  the  Missile  Panel\\nmeetings and my interaction with Gp Capt Narayanan also\\nincreased.\\n\\nIn 1968, Prof. Sarabhai came to Thumba on one of his\\nroutine visits. He was shown the operation of the nose-cone\\njettisoning mechanism. As always, we were all anxious to\\nshare  the  results  of  our  work  with  Prof.  Sarabhai.  We\\nrequested  Prof.  Sarabhai  to  formally  activate  the  pyro\\nsystem through a timer circuit. Prof. Sarabhai smiled, and\\npressed  the  button.  To  our  horror,  nothing  happened.  We\\nwere  dumbstruck.  I  looked  at  Pramod  Kale,  who  had\\ndesigned and integrated the timer circuit. In a flash each of\\nus  mentally  went  through  an  anlysis  of  the  failure.  We\\nrequested Prof. Sarabhai to wait for a few minutes, then we\\ndetached the timer device, giving direct connection to the\\npyros. Prof. Sarabhai pressed the button again. The pyros\\nwere  fired  and  the  nose  cone  was  jettisoned.  Prof.\\nSarabhai  congratulated  Kale  and  me;  but  his  expression\\nsuggested that his thoughts were elsewhere. We could not\\nguess what was on his mind. The suspense did not last for\\nlong and I got a call from Prof. Sarabhai’s secretary to meet\\nhim after dinner for an important discussion.\\n\\nProf.  Sarabhai  was  staying  at  the  Kovalam  Palace\\nHotel,  his  usual  home  whenever  he  was  in  Trivandrum.  I\\nwas  slightly  perplexed  by  the  summons.  Prof.  Sarabhai\\ngreeted  me  with  his  customary  warmth.  He  talked  of  the\\nrocket  launching  station,  envisaging  facilities  like  launch\\npads,  block  houses,  radar,  telemetry  and  so  on—things\\nwhich are taken for granted in Indian space research today.\\nThen  he  brought  up  the  incident  that  had  occurred  that\\nmorning.  This  was  exactly  what \\nfeared.  My\\napprehension of a reproach from my leader, however, was\\nunfounded. Prof. Sarabhai did not conclude that the failure\\nof  the  pyro  timer  circuit  was  the  outcome  of  insufficient\\nknowledge and lack of skill on the part of his people or of\\nfaulty  understanding  at  the  direction  stage.  He  asked  me\\ninstead, if we were unenthused by a job that did not pose\\nsufficient  challenge.  He  also  asked  me  to  consider  if  my\\nwork was possibly being affected by any problem of which I\\nwas  hitherto  unaware.  He  finally  put  his  finger  on  the  key\\nissue.  We  lacked  a  single  roof  to  carry  out  system\\nintegration  of  all  our  rocket  stages  and  rocket  systems.\\n\\nI  had \\n\\n\\x0cElectrical  and  mechanical  integration  work  was  going  on\\nwith  a  significant  phase  difference—both  in  time  and  in\\nspace. There was little effort to bring together the disparate\\nwork  on  electrical  and  mechanical \\nintegration.  Prof.\\nSarabhai spent the next hour in re-defining our tasks, and,\\nin the small hours of the morning, the decision to set up a\\nRocket Engineering Section was taken.\\n\\nMistakes can delay or prevent the proper achievement\\nof  the  objectives  of  individuals  and  organizations,  but  a\\nvisionary \\nlike  Prof.  Sarabhai  can  use  errors  as\\nopportunities to promote innovation and the development of\\nnew  ideas.  He  was  not  especially  concerned  with  the\\nmistake  in  the  timer  circuit,  least  of  all  with  pinning  the\\nblame for it. Prof. Sarabhai’s approach to mistakes rested\\non  the  assumption  that  they  were  inevitable  but  generally\\nmanageable. It was in the handling of the crises that arose\\nas a consequence that talent could often be revealed. I later\\nrealised by experience, that the best way to prevent errors\\nwas to anticipate them. But this time, by a strange twist of\\nfate, the failure of the timer circuit led to the birth of a rocket\\nengineering laboratory.\\n\\nIt  was  my  usual  practice  to  brief  Prof.  Sarabhai  after\\nevery  Missile  Panel  Meeting.  After  attending  one  such\\nmeeting in Delhi on 30 December 1971, I was returning to\\nTrivandrum.  Prof.  Sarabhai  was  visiting  Thumba  that  very\\nday  to  review  the  SLV  design.  I  spoke  to  him  on  the\\ntelephone  from  the  airport  lounge  about  the  salient  points\\nthat had emerged at the panel meeting. He instructed me to\\nwait  at  Trivandrum  Airport  after  disembarking  from  the\\nDelhi flight, and to meet him there before his departure for\\nBombay the same night.\\n\\nWhen I reached Trivandrum, a pall of gloom hung in the\\nair. The aircraft ladder operator Kutty told me in a choked\\nvoice  that  Prof.  Sarabhai  was  no  more.  He  had  passed\\naway  a  few  hours  ago,  following  a  cardiac  arrest.  I  was\\nshocked to the core; it had happened within an hour of our\\nconversation. It was a great blow to me and a huge loss to\\nIndian  science.  That  night  passed  in  preparations  for\\nairlifting  Prof.  Sarabhai’s  body  for  the  cremation  in\\nAhmedabad.\\n\\nFor  five  years,  between  1966  to  1971,  about  22\\nscientists  and  engineers  had  worked  closely  with  Prof.\\nSarabhai. All of them were later to take charge of important\\nscientific  projects.  Not  only  was  Prof.  Sarabhai  a  great\\nscientist,  but  also  a  great  leader.  I  still  remember  him\\nreviewing the bi-monthly progress of the design projects of\\nSLV-3 in June 1970. Presentations on Stages I to IV were\\narranged.  The  first  three  presentations  went  through\\nsmoothly. Mine was the last presentation. I introduced five\\nof my team members who had contributed in various ways\\nto  the  design.  To  everybody’s  surprise,  each  of  them\\npresented  his  portion  of  the  work  with  authority  and\\nconfidence.  The  presentations  were  discussed  at  length\\nand the conclusion was that satisfactory progress had been\\nmade.\\n\\nSuddenly,  a  senior  scientist  who  worked  closely  with\\nProf.  Sarabhai  turned  to  me  and  enquired,  “Well,  the\\npresentations  for  your  project  were  made  by  your  team\\nmembers based on their work. But what did you do for the\\nproject?” That was the first time I saw Prof. Sarabhai really\\nannoyed.  He  told  his  colleague,  “You  ought  to  know  what\\nproject  management  is  all  about.  We  just  witnessed  an\\nexcellent example. It was an outstanding demonstration of\\nteam  work.  I  have  always  seen  a  project  leader  as  an\\nintegrator of people and that is precisely what Kalam is.” I\\nconsider Prof. Sarabhai as the Mahatma Gandhi of Indian\\n\\n\\x0cscience —generating leadership qualities in his team and\\ninspiring them through both ideas and example.\\n\\nAfter an interim arrangement with Prof. MGK Menon at\\nthe helm, Prof. Satish Dhawan was given the responsibility\\nof  heading  ISRO.  The  whole  complex  at  Thumba,  which\\nincluded  TERLS,  the  Space  Science  and  Technology\\nCentre  (SSTC),  the  RPP,  the  Rocket  Fabrication  Facility\\n(RFF),  and  the  Propellant  Fuel  Complex  (PFC)  were\\nmerged  together  to  form  an  integrated  space  centre  and\\nchristened the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) as\\na  tribute  to  the  man  to  whom  it  owed  its  existence.  The\\nrenowned metallurgist, Dr Brahm Prakash, took over as the\\nfirst Director of VSSC.\\n\\nThe  RATO  system  was  successfully  tested  on  8\\nOctober 1972 at Bareilly Air Force station in Uttar Pradesh,\\nwhen  a  high  performance  Sukhoi-16  jet  aircraft  became\\nairborne after a short run of 1200 m, as against its usual run\\nof  2  km.  We  used  the  66th  RATO  motor  in  the  test.  The\\ndemonstration was watched by Air Marshal Shivdev Singh\\nand Dr BD Nag Chaudhury, then the Scientific Adviser to\\nthe  Defence  Minister.  This  effort  was  said  to  have  saved\\napproximately Rs 4 crores in foreign exchange. The vision\\nof the industrialist scientist had finally borne fruit.\\n\\nin \\n\\nIndia  and  becoming \\n\\nBefore taking up the responsibility of organizing space\\nresearch \\nthe  chairman  of\\nINCOSPAR,  Prof.  Sarabhai  had  established  a  number  of\\nsuccessful  industrial  enterprises.  He  was  aware  that\\nscientific research could not survive in isolation, away from\\nindustry.  Prof.  Sarabhai  founded  Sarabhai  Chemicals,\\nSarabhai Glass, Sarabhai Geigy Limited, Sarabhai Merck\\nLimited, and the Sarabhai Engineering Group. His Swastik\\nOil  Mills  did  pioneering  work  in  the  extraction  of  oil  from\\noilseeds,  manufacture  of  synthetic  detergents  and  of\\ncosmetics. He geared Standard Pharmaceuticals Limited\\nto enable large-scale manufacture of penicillin, which was\\nimported  from  abroad  at  astronomical  costs  at  that  time.\\nNow  with  the  indigenization  of  RATO,  his  mission  had\\nacquired  a  new  dimension—independence \\nthe\\nmanufacture of military hardware and the potential saving of\\ncrores of rupees in foreign exchange. I recalled this on the\\nday  of  the  successful  trial  of  the  RATO  system.  Including\\ntrial  expenses,  we  spent  less  than  Rs.  25  lakhs  on  the\\nentire  project.  The  Indian  RATO  could  be  produced  at\\nRs.17,000  apiece,  and  it  replaced  the  imported  RATO,\\nwhich cost Rs. 33,000.\\n\\nin \\n\\nAt  the  Vikram  Sarabhai  Space  Centre,  work  on  the\\nSLV  went  on  at  full  swing. All  the  subsystems  had  been\\ndesigned,  technologies  identified,  processes  established,\\nwork  centres  selected,  manpower  earmarked  and\\nschedules  drawn.  The  only  hitch  was  the  lack  of  a\\nmanagement  structure  to  effectively  handle  this  mega-\\nproject and coordinate activities which were spread over a\\nlarge  number  of  work  centres  with  their  own  ways  of\\nworking and management.\\n\\nProf.  Dhawan,  in  consultation  with  Dr  Brahm  Prakash,\\npicked  me  for  this  job.  I  was  appointed  the  Project\\nManager—SLV,  and  reported  directly  to  the  Director,\\nVSSC. My first task was to work out a project management\\nplan. I wondered why I was selected for this task when there\\nwere stalwarts like Gowarikar, Muthunayagam, and Kurup\\naround. With organizers like Easwardas, Aravamudan, and\\nSC Gupta available, how would I do better? I articulated my\\ndoubts to Dr Brahm Prakash. He told me not to focus on\\nwhat  I  saw  as  other  people’s  strengths  compared  to  my\\nown, but instead, to attempt to expand their abilities.\\n\\n\\x0cfrom \\n\\nDr  Brahm  Prakash  advised  me  to  take  care  of  the\\nperformance  degraders  and  cautioned  me  against\\noutrightly  seeking  optimal  performance \\nthe\\nparticipating  work  centres.  “Everyone  will  work  to  create\\ntheir  bit  of  SLV;  your  problem  is  going  to  be  your\\ndependency on others in accomplishing the total SLV. The\\nSLV  mission  will  be  accomplished  with,  and  through,  a\\nlarge  number  of  people.  You  will  require  a  tremendous\\namount of tolerance and patience,” he said. It reminded me\\nof what my father used to read to me from the Holy Qur’an\\non the distinction between right and wrong: “We have sent\\nno  apostle  before  you  who  did  not  eat  or  walk  about  the\\nmarket squares. We test you by means of one another. Will\\nyou not have patience?”\\n\\nI was aware of the contradiction that often occurred in\\nsuch  situations.  People  heading  teams  often  have  one  of\\nthe  following  two  orientations:  for  some,  work  is  the  most\\nimportant  motivation;  for  others,  their  workers  are  the  all-\\nconsuming interest. There are many others who fall either\\nbetween these two positions or outside them. My job was\\ngoing to be to avoid those who were interested neither in\\nthe  work  nor  in  the  workers.  I  was  determined  to  prevent\\npeople  from  taking  either  extreme,  and  to  promote\\nconditions  where  work  and  workers  went  together.  I\\nvisualized  my  team  as  a  group  in  which  each  member\\nworked to enrich the others in the team and experience the\\nenjoyment of working together.\\n\\nThe primary objectives of the SLV Project were design,\\ndevelopment  and  operation  of  a  standard  SLV  system,\\nSLV-3,  capable  of  reliably  and  expeditiously  fulfilling  the\\nspecified mission of launching a 40 kg satellite into a 400\\nkm circular orbit around the earth.\\n\\nAs a first step, I translated the primary project objectives\\ninto some major tasks. One such task was the development\\nof a rocket motor system for the four stages of the vehicle.\\nThe  critical  problems  in  the  completion  of  this  task  were:\\nmaking an 8.6 tonne propellant grain and a high mass ratio\\napogee rocket motor system which would use highenergy\\npropellants. Another task was vehicle control and guidance.\\nThree types of control systems were involved in this task—\\naerodynamic  surface  control,  thrust  vector  control  and\\nreaction  control  for  the  first,  second  and  third  stages  and\\nthe  spin-up  mechanism  for  the  fourth  stage.  Inertial\\nreference for control systems and guidance through inertial\\nmeasurement was also imperative. Yet another major task\\nwas  the  augmentation  of  launch  facilities  at  SHAR  with\\nsystems \\nfacilities  and\\ndevelopment of launch support systems such as launchers\\nand vehicle assembly fixtures. A target of ‘all line’ flight test\\nwithin 64 months was set in March 1973.\\n\\nintegration  and \\n\\ncheckout \\n\\nI  took  up  the  executive  responsibility  of  implementing\\nthe project within the framework of policy decisions taken,\\nthe approved management plan, and the project report; and\\nalso within the budget and through the powers delegated to\\nme by the Director, VSSC. Dr Brahm Prakash formed four\\nProject Advisory Committees to advise me on specialized\\nareas like rocket motors, materials and fabrication, control\\nand  guidance,  electronics,  and  mission  and  launching.  I\\nwas assured of the guidance of outstanding scientists like\\nDS  Rane,  Muthunayagam,  TS  Prahlad,  AR  Acharya,  SC\\nGupta, and CL Amba Rao, to name a few.\\n\\nThe  Holy  Qur’an  says:  “We  have  sent  down  to  you\\nrevelations  showing  you  an  account  of  those  who  have\\ngone  before  you  and  an  admonition  to  righteous  men.”  I\\nsought  to  share  the  wisdom  of  these  extremely  brilliant\\npeople. “Light upon light. Allah guides to His light whom He\\n\\n\\x0cwill. He has knowledge of all things.”\\n\\nsubsystems \\n\\nWe made three groups to carry out the project activities\\n—a  Programme  Management  Group,  an  Integration  and\\nFlight  Testing  Group  and  a  Subsystems  Development\\nGroup.  The  first  Group  was  made  responsible  for  looking\\nafter  the  overall  executive  aspects  of  SLV-3:  project\\nincluding  administration,  planning  and\\nmanagement, \\nevaluation, \\nspecifications,  materials,\\nfabrication,  quality  assurance  and  control.  The  Integration\\nand  Flight  Testing  Group  was  assigned  the  tasks  of\\ngeneration  of  facilities  required  for  integration  and  flight\\ntesting  of  SLV-3.  They  were  also  asked  to  carry  out  the\\nthe  vehicle, \\nanalysis  of \\nincluding  mechanical  and\\naerodynamic \\ninterface  problems.  The  Subsystems\\nDevelopment  Group  was  given  the  job  of  interacting  with\\nvarious divisions of VSSC and was made responsible for\\nensuring that all technological problems in the development\\nof  various  subsystems  were  overcome  by  creating  a\\nsynergy amongst the available talent in these divisions.\\n\\nI  projected  a  requirement  of  275  engineers  and\\nscientists for SLV-3 but could get only about 50. If it had not\\nbeen  for  synergistic  efforts,  the  whole  project  would  have\\nremained  a  non-starter.  Some  young  engineers  like  MSR\\nDev,  G  Madhavan  Nair,  S  Srinivasan,  US  Singh,\\nSunderrajan,  Abdul  Majeed,  Ved  Prakash  Sandlas,\\nNamboodiri,  Sasi  Kumar,  and  Sivathanu  Pillai  developed\\ntheir  own  ground  rules  designed  to  help  them  work\\nefficiently  as  a  project  team,  and  produced  outstanding\\nindividual and team results. These men were in the habit of\\ncelebrating  their  successes  together—in  a  sort  of  mutual\\nappreciation club. This boosted morale, and helped them a\\ngreat deal to accept setbacks and to revitalize themselves\\nafter periods of intense work.\\n\\nEach  member  of  the  SLV-3  project  team  was  a\\nspecialist in his own field. It was natural therefore that each\\none  of  them  valued  his  independence.  To  manage  the\\nperformance  of  such  specialists  the  team  leader  has  to\\nadopt  a  delicate  balance  between  the  hands-on  and  the\\nhands-off  approach.  The  hands-on  approach  takes  an\\nactive  interest  on  a  very  regular  basis  in  the  members’\\nwork.  The  hands-off  approach  trusts  team  members  and\\nrecognizes their need for autonomy to carry out their roles,\\nas they see fit. It hinges on their self-motivation. When the\\nleader goes too far with the hands-on approach, he is seen\\nas an anxious and interfering type. If he goes too far hands-\\noff, he is seen as abdicating his responsibility or not being\\ninterested.  Today,  the  members  of  the  SLV-3  team  have\\ngrown  to  lead  some  of  the  country’s  most  prestigious\\nprogrammes.

I used to prepare a general schedule\\nduring my morning walk, and emphasize two or three things\\nI  would  definitely  like  to  accomplish  during  the  day,\\nincluding  at  least  one  thing  that  would  help  achieve  long-\\nterm goals.\\n\\nOnce in the office, I would clean the table first. Within the\\nnext  ten  minutes,  I  would  scan  all  the  papers  and  quickly\\ndivide  them  into  different  categories:  those  that  required\\nimmediate action, low priority ones, ones that could be kept\\npending,  and  reading  material.  Then  I  would  put  the  high\\npriority  papers  in  front  of  me  and  everything  else  out  of\\nsight.\\n\\nComing back to SLV-3, about 250 sub-assemblies and\\n44  major  subsystems  were  conceived  during  the  design.\\nThe list of materials went up to over 1 million components.\\nA project implementation strategy had become essential to\\nachieve  sustained  viability  of  this  complex  programme  of\\nseven to ten years’ duration. From his side, Prof. Dhawan\\ncame up with a clear statement that all the manpower and\\nfunds at VSSC and SHAR would have to be directed to us.\\nFrom our side, we evolved a matrix type of management to\\nachieve  productive \\nthan  300\\nindustries.  The  target  was  that  our  interaction  with  them\\nmust lead to their technology empowerment. Three things I\\nstressed  before  my  colleagues—importance  of  design\\ncapability, goal setting and realisation, and the strength to\\nwithstand  setbacks.  Now,  before  I  dwell  on  the  finer\\naspects  of  the  management  of  the  SLV-3  project,  let  me\\ntalk about the SLV-3 itself.\\n\\ninterfacing  with  more \\n\\nIt \\n\\nis \\n\\ninteresting \\n\\nto  describe  a \\n\\nlaunch  vehicle\\nanthropomorphically.  The  main  mechanical  structure  may\\nbe visualized as the body of a human being, the control and\\ntheir  associated  electronics\\nguidance  systems  with \\nconstitute \\nfrom\\npropellants.  How  are  they  made?  What  are  the  materials\\nand techniques involved?\\n\\nthe  brain.  The  musculature  comes \\n\\nA  large  variety  of  materials  go  into  the  making  of  a\\nlaunch  vehicle—  both  metallic  and  non-metallic,  which\\ninclude composites and ceramics. In metals, different types\\nof stainless steel, alloys of aluminium, magnesium, titanium,\\ncopper,  beryllium,  tungsten  and  molybdenum  are  used.\\nComposite  materials  are  composed  of  a  mixture  or\\ncombination of two or more constituents which differ in form\\nand  material  composition  and  which  are  essentially\\ninsoluble in one another. The materials which combine may\\nbe  metallic,  organic  or  inorganic.  While  other  material\\ncombinations  possible  are  virtually  unlimited,  the  most\\ntypical composites in launch vehicles are made of structural\\nconstituents,  embedded  in  a  matrix.  We  used  a  large\\nvariety  of  glass  fibre  reinforced  plastic  composites  and\\nopened  avenues  for  the  entry  of  Kevlar,  polyamides  and\\ncarbon-carbon composites. Ceramics are special types of\\nbaked clay used for microwave transparent enclosures. We\\nconsidered using ceramics, but had to reject the idea then\\ndue to technological limitations.\\n\\n\\x0cThrough  mechanical  engineering,  these  materials  are\\ntransformed  into  hardware.  In  fact,  of  all  the  engineering\\ndisciplines  which  feed  directly  into  the  development  of\\nrocketry,  mechanical  engineering  is  perhaps  the  most\\nintrinsic  one.  Be  it  a  sophisticated  system  like  a  liquid\\nengine or a piece of hardware as simple as a fastener, its\\nultimate  fabrication  calls  for  expert  mechanical  engineers\\nand  precision  machine  tools.  We  decided  to  develop\\nimportant technologies like welding techniques for low-alloy\\nstainless  steel,  electroforming \\ntechniques,  and  ultra-\\nprecision process tooling. We also decided to make some\\nimportant  machines  in-house,  like  the  254-litre  vertical\\nmixer  and  the  groove  machining  facility  for  our  third  and\\nfourth  stages.  Many  of  our  subsystems  were  so  massive\\nand  complex  that  they  implied  sizeable  financial  outlays.\\nWithout  any  hesitation,  we  approached  industries  in  the\\nprivate sector and developed contract management plans\\nwhich  later  became  blueprints  for  many  government-run\\nscience and technology business organizations.\\n\\nComing to the life part of the SLV, there is the complex\\nelectrical  circuitry,  which  sets  the  mechanical  structure  in\\nmotion.  This  vast  spectrum  of  activities,  encompassing\\nsimple  electrical  power  supplies \\nto  sophisticated\\ninstrumentation as well as guidance and control systems is\\ncollectively referred to in aerospace research as ‘Avionics’.\\nDevelopment efforts in avionic systems had already been\\ninitiated  at  VSSC  in  the  field  of  digital  electronics,\\nmicrowave  radars  and  radar  transponders,  and  inertial\\ncomponents and systems. It is very important to know the\\nstate  of  the  SLV  when  it  is  in  flight.  SLV  brought  a  new\\nsurge  of  activity  in  the  development  of  a  variety  of\\ntransducers  for  measurement  of  physical  parameters  like\\npressure, \\nthrust,  vibration,  acceleration,  etc.  The\\ntransducers convert the physical parameters of the vehicle\\ninto  electrical  signals.  An  on-board  telemetry  system\\nprocesses these signals suitably and transmits them in the\\nform of radio signals to the ground stations, where they are\\nreceived  and  deciphered  back  to  the  original  information\\ncollected by the transducers. If the systems work according\\nto  design  there  is  little  cause  for  concern;  but  in  case\\nsomething  goes  wrong,  the  vehicle  must  be  destroyed  to\\nstop  it  from  making  any  unexpected  moves.  To  ensure\\nsafety,  a  special  tele-command  system  was  made  to\\ndestroy  the  rocket  in  case  it  malfunctions,  and  an\\ninterferrometer  system  was  developed  to  determine  the\\nrange and position of the SLV, as a added means to the\\nradar system. The SLV project also initiated the indigenous\\nproduction  of  sequencers  which  time  the  various  events,\\nsuch  as \\nignition,  stage  separation,  vehicle  altitude\\nprogrammers  which  store  the  information  for  the  rocket\\ntake\\nmanoeuvres,  and  auto-pilot  electronics  which \\nappropriate  decisions \\nits\\npredetermined path.\\n\\nthe  rocket  along \\n\\nto  steer \\n\\nWithout the energy to propel the whole system, a launch\\nvehicle  remains  grounded.  A  propellant  is  usually  a\\ncombustible  substance  that  produces  heat  and  supplies\\nejection particles in a rocket engine. It is both a source of\\nenergy  and  a  working  substance  for  expanding  energy.\\nBecause the distinction is more decisive in rocket engines,\\nthe term propellant is used primarily to describe chemicals\\ncarried by rockets for propulsive purposes.\\n\\nIt is customary to classify propellants as either solids or\\nliquids.  We  concentrated  on  solid  propellants.  A  solid\\npropellant  consists  essentially  of  three  components:  the\\noxidizer,  the  fuel  and  the  additives.  Solid  propellants  are\\nfurther  classified  into  two  types:  composite  and  double\\n\\n\\x0cbase.  The  former  consists  of  an  oxidizer  or  inorganic\\nmaterial (like ammonium perchlorate) in a matrix of organic\\nfuel  (like  synthetic  rubber).  Double  base  propellants  were\\ndistant  dreams  those  days  but  nevertheless  we  dared  to\\ndream about them.\\n\\nAll  this  self  sufficiency  and  indigenous  manufacture\\ncame  gradually,  and  not  always  without  pain.  We  were  a\\nteam  of  almost  self-trained  engineers.  In  retrospect  I  feel\\nthe  unique  blend  of  our  untutored  talent,  character,  and\\ndedication  suited  SLV  development  the  most.  Problems\\nsurfaced  regularly  and  almost  consistently.  But  my  team\\nmembers never exhausted my patience. I recall writing after\\nwinding up a late night shift:\\n\\nBeautiful hands are those that do\\nWork that is earnest and brave and true\\nMoment by moment\\nThe long day through.\\n\\nAlmost  parallel  to  our  work  on  SLV,  the  DRDO  was\\npreparing itself for developing an indigenous surface-to-air\\nmissile.  The  RATO  project  was  abandoned  because  the\\naircraft  for  which  it  was  designed  became  obsolete.  The\\nnew aircraft did not need RATO. With the project called off,\\nNarayanan was DRDO’s logical choice to lead the team for\\nmaking  the  missile.  Unlike  us  at  ISRO,  they  preferred  the\\nphilosophy of one-toone substitution rather than technology\\ndevelopment and performance upgrading. The Surface-to-\\nAir Missile SA–2 of Russian origin was chosen to acquire\\ndetailed  knowledge  of  all  the  design  parameters  of  a\\nproven  missile  and  to  establish,  thereby,  the  necessary\\ninfrastructure  required  in  the  organization.  It  was  thought\\nthat  once  one-to-one  indigenization  was  established,\\nfurther  advances  in  the  sophisticated  field  of  guided\\nmissiles  would  be  a  natural  fall-out.  The  project  was\\nsanctioned in February 1972 with the code name Devil and\\nfunding of about Rs. 5 crore was made available for the first\\nthree years. Almost half of it was to go in foreign exchange.\\nBy now promoted to Air Commodore, Narayanan took\\nover as Director, DRDL. He mobilized this young laboratory\\nlocated in the southeastern suburbs of Hyderabad to take\\nup  this  enormous  task.  The  landscape  dotted  with  tombs\\nand  old  buildings  started  reverberating  with  new  life.\\nNarayanan  was  a  man  of  tremendous  energy—a  man\\nalways  in  the  boost  phase.  He  gathered  around  him  a\\nstrong group of enthusiastic people, drawing many service\\nofficers  into  this  predominantly  civilian  laboratory.  Totally\\npreoccupied  with  the  SLV  affairs,  my  participation  in  the\\nMissile  Panel  meetings  gradually  dwindled,  and  then\\nstopped altogether. However, stories about Narayanan and\\nhis  Devil  were  beginning \\nreach  Trivandrum.  A\\ntransformation of an unprecedented scale was taking place\\nthere.\\n\\nto \\n\\nDuring  my  association  with  Narayanan  in  the  RATO\\nproject, I had discovered that he was a hard taskmaster—\\none who went all out for control, mastery and domination. I\\nused  to  wonder  if  managers  like  him,  who  aim  at  getting\\nresults no matter what the price, would face a rebellion of\\nsilence and non-cooperation in the long run.\\n\\nNew Year’s day, 1975, brought with it an opportunity to\\nhave a firstperson assessment of the work going on under\\nNarayanan’s  leadership.  Prof.  MGK  Menon,  who  was\\nworking then as Scientific Advisor to the Defence Minister\\nand was head of the DRDO, appointed a review committee\\nunder  the  chairmanship  of  Dr  Brahm  Prakash  to  evaluate\\nthe work carried out in the Devil Project. I was taken into the\\nteam as a rocket specialist to evaluate the progress made\\n\\n\\x0cin  the  areas  of  aerodynamics,  structure  and  propulsion  of\\nthe missile. On the propulsion aspects, I was assisted by\\nBR  Somasekhar  and  by  Wg  Cdr  P  Kamaraju.  The\\ncommittee members included Dr RP Shenoy and Prof. IG\\nSarma who were to review the work done on the electronic\\nsystems.\\n\\nWe met at DRDL on 1 and 2 January 1975, followed by\\na  second  session  after  about  six  weeks.  We  visited  the\\nvarious  development  work  centres  and  held  discussions\\nwith  the  scientists  there.  I  was  greatly  impressed  by  the\\nvision  of  AV  Ranga  Rao,  the  dynamism  of  Wg  Cdr  R\\nGopalaswami,  the  thoroughness  of  Dr  I Achyuta  Rao,  the\\nenterprise  of  G  Ganesan,  S  Krishnan’s  clarity  of  thought\\nand R Balakrishnan’s critical eye for detail. The calm of JC\\nBhattacharya  and  Lt  Col  R  Swaminathan  in  the  face  of\\nimmense  complexities  was  striking.  The  zeal  and\\napplication of Lt Col VJ Sundaram was conspicuous. They\\nwere  a  brilliant,  committed  group  of  people—a  mix  of\\nservice  officers  and  civilian  scientists—who  had  trained\\nthemselves  in  the  areas  of  their  own  interest  out  of  their\\ndriving urge to fly an Indian missile.\\n\\nWe  had  our  concluding  meeting  towards  the  end  of\\nMarch 1975 at Trivandrum. We felt that the progress in the\\nexecution  of  the  project  was  adequate  in  respect  of\\nhardware fabrication to carry out the philosophy of one-to-\\none substitution of missile subsystems except in the liquid\\nrocket  area,  where  some  more  time  was  required  to\\nsucceed. The committee was of the unanimous opinion that\\nDRDL had achieved the twin goals of hardware fabrication\\nand  system  analysis  creditably \\nthe  design  and\\ndevelopment  of  the  ground  electronics  complex  assigned\\nto them.\\n\\nin \\n\\nthat \\n\\nWe  observed \\n\\nthe  one-to-one  substitution\\nphilosophy  had  taken  precedence  over  the  generation  of\\ndesign data. Consequently, many design engineers had not\\nbeen  able  to  pay  adequate  attention  to  the  necessary\\nanalysis  which  was  the  practice  followed  by  us  at  VSSC.\\nThe system analysis studies carried out up to then had also\\nbeen  only  of  a  preliminary  nature.  In  all,  the  results\\naccomplished were outstanding, but we still had a long way\\nto go. I recalled a school poem:\\n\\nDon’t worry and fret, fainthearted,\\n\\nThe chances have just begun,\\nFor the best jobs haven’t been started,\\nThe best work hasn’t been done.\\n\\nto  give  Devil  a \\n\\nThe committee made a strong recommendation to the\\nGovernment \\nfurther  go-ahead.  Our\\nrecommendation was accepted and the project proceeded.\\nBack  home  at  VSSC,  SLV  was  taking  shape.  In\\ncontrast to the DRDL which was sprinting ahead, we were\\nmoving slowly. Instead of following the leader, my team was\\ntrekking towards success on several individual paths. The\\nessence  of  our  method  of  work  was  an  emphasis  on\\ncommunication,  particularly  in  the  lateral  direction,  among\\nthe teams and within the teams. In a way, communication\\nwas my mantra for managing this gigantic project. To get\\nthe best from my team members, I spoke to them frequently\\non \\nthe  organization,\\nemphasizing  the  importance  of  each  member’s  specific\\ncontribution  towards  the  realisation  of  these  goals. At  the\\nsame time, I tried to be receptive to every constructive idea\\nemanating  from  my  subordinates  and  to  relay  it  in  an\\nappropriate \\nand\\nimplementation. I had written somewhere in my diary of that\\nperiod:\\n\\nthe  goals  and  objectives  of \\n\\nexamination \\n\\ncritical \\n\\nform \\n\\nfor \\n\\n\\x0cIf you want to leave your footprints\\n\\nOn the sands of time\\nDo not drag your feet.\\n\\nMost  of  the  time,  communication  gets  confused  with\\nconversation.  In  fact,  the  two  are  distinctly  different.  I  was\\n(and am) a terrible conversationalist but consider myself a\\ngood communicator. A conversation full of pleasantries is\\nmost  often  devoid  of  any  useful  information,  whereas\\nthe  exchange  of\\ncommunication \\ninformation. \\nthat\\nrealise \\nto \\nIt \\ncommunication is a twoparty affair which aims at passing\\non or receiving a specific piece of information.\\n\\nis  meant  only \\nis  very \\n\\nfor \\nimportant \\n\\nWhile  working  on  the  SLV,  I  used  communication  to\\npromote understanding and to come to an agreement with\\ncolleagues  in  defining  the  problems  that  existed  and  in\\nidentifying the action necessary to be taken to solve them.\\nAuthentic communication was one of the tools skilfully used\\nin managing the project. How did I do that ? To begin with, I\\ntried to be factual and never sugar-coated the bitter pill of\\nfacts. At one of the Space Science Council (SSC) review\\nmeetings,  frustrated  by  the  procurement  delays,  I  erupted\\ninto an agitated complaint against the indifference and red-\\ntape  tactics  of  the  controller  of  accounts  and  financial\\nadvisor  of  VSSC.  I  insisted  that  the  systems  of  work\\nto  change  and\\nfollowed  by \\ndemanded  the  delegation  of  their  functions  to  the  project\\nteam. Dr Brahm Prakash was taken aback by the bluntness\\nof my submission. He stubbed out his cigarette and walked\\nout of the meeting.\\n\\nthe  accounts  staff  had \\n\\nI  spent  the  whole  night  regretting  the  pain  my  harsh\\nwords  had  caused  Dr  Brahm  Prakash.  However,  I  was\\ndetermined to fight the inertia built into the system before I\\nfound myself being dragged down with it. I asked myself a\\npractical  question:  could  one  live  with  these  insensitive\\nbureaucrats?  The  answer  was  a  big  no.  Then  I  asked\\nmyself  a  private  question:  what  would  hurt  Dr  Brahm\\nPrakash  more,  my  seemingly  harsh  words  now,  or  the\\nburial  of  the  SLV  at  a  later  stage?  Finding  my  head  and\\nheart agreeing, I prayed to God for help. Fortunately for me,\\nDr  Brahm  Prakash  delegated  financial  powers  to  the\\nproject the next morning.\\n\\nif  he \\n\\nAnyone  who  has  taken  up  the  responsibility  to  lead  a\\nteam  can  be  successful  only \\nis  sufficiently\\nindependent,  powerful  and  influential  in  his  own  right  to\\nbecome a person to reckon with. This is perhaps also the\\npath  to  individual  satisfaction  in  life,  for  freedom  with\\nresponsibility \\nfor  personal\\nhappiness.  What  can  one  do  to  strengthen  personal\\nfreedom?  I  would  like  to  share  with  you  two  techniques  I\\nadopt in this regard.\\n\\nthe  only  sound  basis \\n\\nis \\n\\ntaken  away \\n\\nFirst,  by  building  your  own  education  and  skills.\\nKnowledge  is  a  tangible  asset,  quite  often  the  most\\nimportant  tool  in  your  work.  The  more  up-to-date  the\\nknowledge  you  possess,  the  freer  you  are.  Knowledge\\nfrom  anyone  except  by\\ncannot  be \\nobsolescence. A leader can only be free to lead his team if\\nhe keeps abreast of all that is happening around him—in\\nreal  time.  To  lead,  in  a  way,  is  to  engage  in  continuing\\neducation. In many countries, it is normal for professionals\\nto  go  to  college  several  nights  every  week.  To  be  a\\nsuccessful team leader, one has to stay back after the din\\nand clutter of a working day to emerge better-equipped and\\nready to face a new day.\\n\\nThe  second  way  is  to  develop  a  passion  for  personal\\nresponsibility. The sovereign way to personal freedom is to\\n\\n\\x0chelp  determine  the  forces  that  determine  you.  Be  active!\\nTake on responsibility! Work for the things you believe in. If\\nyou  do  not,  you  are  surrendering  your  fate  to  others.  The\\nhistorian  Edith  Hamilton  wrote  of  ancient  Greece,  “When\\nthe  freedom  they  wished  for  most  was  freedom  from\\nresponsibility,  then  Athens  ceased  to  be  free  and  was\\nnever free again”. The truth is that there is a great deal that\\nmost of us can individually do to increase our freedom. We\\ncan combat the forces that threaten to oppress us. We can\\nfortify  ourselves  with  the  qualities  and  conditions  that\\npromote individual freedom. In doing so, we help to create\\na \\nachieving\\nunprecedented goals.\\n\\norganization, \\n\\nstronger \\n\\ncapable \\n\\nof \\n\\nAs work on the SLV gained momentum, Prof. Dhawan\\nintroduced the system of reviewing progress with the entire\\nteam involved in the project. Prof. Dhawan was a man with\\na mission. He would effortlessly pull together all the loose\\nends  to  make  work  move  smoothly. At  VSSC  the  review\\nmeetings  presided  over  by  Prof.  Dhawan  used  to  be\\nconsidered  major  events.  He  was  a  true  captain  of  the\\nISRO  ship—a  commander,  navigator,  housekeeper,  all\\nrolled into one. Yet, he never pretended to know more than\\nhe did. Instead, when something appeared ambiguous, he\\nwould  ask  questions  and  discuss  his  doubts  frankly.  I\\nremember him as a leader for whom to lead with a firm, but\\nfair  hand,  was  a  moral  compulsion.  His  mind  used  to  be\\nvery firm once it had been decided on any issue. But before\\ntaking  a  decision,  it  used  to  be  like  clay,  open  to\\nimpressions  until  the  final  moulding.  Then  the  decisions\\nwould be popped into the potter’s oven for glazing, never\\nfailing to emerge hard and tough, resistant and enduring.\\n\\nI had the privilege of spending a great deal of time with\\nProf.  Dhawan.  He  could  hold  the  listener  enthralled\\nbecause of the logical, intellectual acumen he could bring to\\nbear  on  his  analysis  of  any  subject.  He  had  an  unusual\\ncombination  of  degrees—a  B.Sc.  in  Mathematics  and\\nPhysics, an M.A. in English Literature, B.E. in Mechanical\\nEngineering, M.S. in Aeronautical Engineering followed by\\na  Ph.D. \\nthe\\nin  Aeronautics  and  Mathematics \\nCalifornia Institute of Technology (Caltech) in USA.\\n\\nfrom \\n\\nIntellectual debates with him were very stimulating and\\ncould always mentally energize me and my team members.\\nI found him full of optimism and compassion. Although he\\noften  judged  himself  harshly,  with  no  allowances  or\\nexcuses, he was generous to a fault when it came to others.\\nProf.  Dhawan  used  to  sternly  pronounce  his  judgements\\nand then pardon the contrite guilty parties.\\n\\njobs. \\n\\nIn  1975,  ISRO  became  a  government  body. An  ISRO\\ncouncil was formed consisting of Directors of different work\\ncentres  and  senior  officers  in  the  Department  of  Space\\n(DoS). This provided a symbolic link as well as a forum for\\nparticipative management between the DoS which had the\\nGovernmental powers and the centres which would execute\\nthe \\ntraditional  parlance  of  Government\\ndepartments, ISRO’s centres would have been subordinate\\nunits  or  attached  offices,  but  such  words  were  never\\nspoken either at ISRO or DoS. Participative management,\\nwhich calls for active interaction between those who wield\\nadministrative powers and the executing agencies, was a\\nnovel  feature  of  ISRO  management  that  would  go  a  long\\nway in Indian R&D organizations.\\n\\nthe \\n\\nIn \\n\\nThe new set-up brought me in contact with TN Seshan,\\nthe  Joint  Secretary  in  the  DoS.  Till  then,  I  had  a  latent\\nreservation  about  bureaucrats,  so \\nI  was  not  very\\ncomfortable when I first saw Seshan participating in a SLV-\\n3  Management  Board  meeting.  But  soon,  it  changed  to\\n\\n\\x0cadmiration for Seshan, who would meticulously go through\\nthe  agenda  and  always  come  for  the  meetings  prepared.\\nHe  used  to  kindle  the  minds  of  scientists  with  his\\ntremendous analytical capability.\\n\\nto \\n\\nits \\n\\nfathomless  dimensions. \\n\\nThe first three years of the SLV project was the period\\nfor the revelation of many fascinating mysteries of science.\\nBeing  human,  ignorance  has  always  been  with  us,  and\\nalways will be. What was new was my awareness of it, my\\nawakening \\nto\\nerroneously  suppose  that  the  function  of  science  was  to\\nexplain everything, and that unexplained phenomena were\\nthe  province  of  people  like  my  father  and  Lakshmana\\nSastry. However, I always refrained from discussing these\\nmatters with any of my scientist colleagues, fearing that it\\nwould threaten the hegemony of their meticulously formed\\nviews.\\n\\nI  used \\n\\nis \\n\\nresearched  and \\n\\ntechnology,  between \\n\\nGradually,  I  became  aware  of  the  difference  between\\nresearch  and\\nscience  and \\ndevelopment.  Science \\ninherently  open-ended  and\\nexploratory.  Development  is  a  closed  loop.  Mistakes  are\\nimperative  in  development  and  are  made  every  day,  but\\neach  mistake  is  used  for  modification,  upgradation  or\\nbetterment.  Probably,  the  Creator  created  engineers  to\\nmake  scientists  achieve  more.  For  each  time  scientists\\ncome  up  with  a \\nfully\\nthoroughly \\ncomprehended solution, engineers show them yet another\\nlumineu,  yet  one  more  possibility.  I  cautioned  my  team\\nagainst  becoming  scientists.  Science  is  a  passion—a\\nnever-ending  voyage  into  promises  and  possibilities.  We\\nhad  only  limited  time  and  limited  funds.  Our  making  the\\nSLV  depended  upon  our  awareness  of  our  own  limits.  I\\npreferred  existing  workable  solutions  which  would  be  the\\nbest  options.  Nothing  that  is  new  comes  into  time-bound\\nprojects without its own problems. In my opinion, a project\\nleader  should  always  work  with  proven  technologies  in\\nmost of the systems as far as possible and experiment only\\nfrom multiple resources.\\n* * *\\n\\n\\x0c8\\n\\n\\x0cExpedients\\n\\nThe SLV-3 project had been formulated in such a way\\nthat the major technology work centres, both at VSSC and\\nat SHAR could handle propellant production, rocket motor\\ntesting  and  launch  of  any  large  diameter  rocket.  As\\nparticipants in the SLV-3 project, we set three milestones\\nfor  ourselves:  development  and  flight  qualification  of  all\\nsubsystems through sounding rockets by 1975; sub-orbital\\nflights by 1976; and the final orbital flight in 1978. The work\\ntempo  had  picked  up  now  and  the  atmosphere  was\\ncharged with excitement. Wherever I went, our teams had\\nsomething interesting to show me. A large number of things\\nwere  being  done  for  the  first  time  in  the  country  and  the\\ngroundlevel technicians had had no prior exposure to this\\nkind of work. I saw new performance dimensions growing\\namong my team members.\\n\\nPerformance  dimensions  are  factors  that  lead  to\\ncreation. They go beyond competencies such as the skills\\nand knowledge of the individual. Performance dimensions\\nare broader and deeper than what a person must know and\\nbe able to do in order to function well in his or her job. They\\ninclude attitudes, values and character traits. They exist at\\nvarious levels of the human personality. At the behavioural\\nlevel—at  the  outermost  ring  of  the  tree—we  can  observe\\nskills and measure knowledge. Social roles and self-image\\ndimensions  are  found  at  the  intermediate  level.  Motives\\nand  traits  exist  at  the  innermost  or  core  level.  If  we  can\\nidentify  those  performance  dimensions  which  are  most\\nhighly  correlated  with  job  success,  we  can  put  them\\ntogether to form a blueprint for outstanding performance in\\nboth thought and action.\\n\\nAlthough  SLV-3  was  still  in  the  future,  its  subsystems\\nwere being completed. In June 1974, we used the Centaur\\nsounding rocket launch to test some of our critical systems.\\nA  scaled  down  heat  shield  of  SLV,  Rate  Gyro  Unit,  and\\nVehicle  Attitude  Programmer  were  integrated  into  the\\nCentaur  rocket.  The  three  systems  involved  wide-ranging\\nexpertise—  composite  materials,  control  engineering  and\\nsoftware, none of them ever having been tried before in the\\ncountry.  The  test  was  a  complete  success.  Until  then  the\\nIndian Space Programme had not gone beyond sounding\\nrockets and even knowledgeable people were not ready to\\nsee and acknowledge its efforts as anything more serious\\nthan  fiddling  around  with  meteorological  instruments.  For\\nthe  first  time,  we  inspired  the  confidence  of  the  nation.\\nPrime  Minister  Indira  Gandhi  told  Parliament  on  24  July\\n1974,  “The  development  and \\nfabrication  of  relevant\\ntechnologies,  subsystems  and  hardware  (to  make  India’s\\nfirst Satellite Launch Vehicle) are progressing satisfactorily.\\nA  number  of  industries  are  engaged  in  the  fabrication  of\\ncomponents. The first orbital flight by India is scheduled to\\ntake place in 1978.”\\n\\nLike any other act of creation, the creation of the SLV-3\\nalso had its painful moments. One day, when my team and I\\nwere totally engrossed in the preparation of the static test\\nof  the  first  stage  motor,  the  news  of  a  death  in  the  family\\nreached  me.  My  brother-in-law  and  mentor  Jenab Ahmed\\nJallaludin,  was  no  more.  For  a  couple  of  minutes,  I  was\\nimmobilized, I could not think, could not feel anything. When\\nI could focus on my surroundings once more and attempted\\nto participate in the work, I found myself talking incoherently\\n—and then I realised that, with Jallaluddin, a part of me had\\npassed  away  too.  A  vision  of  my  childhood  reappeared\\nbefore  me—evening  walks  around  the  Rameswaram\\n\\n\\x0ctemple,  shining  sand  and  dancing  tides  in  the  moonlight,\\nstars looking down from an unlit sky on a new moon night,\\nJallaluddin  showing  me  the  horizon  sinking  into  the  sea,\\narranging money for my books, and seeing me off at Santa\\nCruz airport. I felt that I had been thrown into a whirlpool of\\ntime  and  space.  My  father,  by  now  more  than  a  hundred\\nyears old, pallbearer for his son-in-law, who had been half\\nhis  age;  the  bereft  soul  of  my  sister  Zohara,  her  wounds\\nfrom  the  loss  of  her  four-year-old  son  still  raw—these\\nimages came before my eyes in a blur, too terrible for me\\nto  comprehend.  I  leaned  on  the  assembly  jig,  composed\\nmyself  and  left  a  few  instructions  with  Dr  S  Srinivasan,\\nDeputy  Project  Director,  to  carry  on  with  the  work  in  my\\nabsence.\\n\\nTravelling overnight in a combination of district buses, I\\nreached Rameswaram only the next day. During this time, I\\ndid  my  best  to  free  myself  from  the  very  past  which\\nappeared to have come to an end with Jallaluddin. But the\\nmoment  I  reached  my  house,  grief  assailed  me  afresh.  I\\nhad no words for Zohara or for my niece Mehboob, both of\\nwhom  were  crying  uncontrollably.  I  had  no  tears  to  shed.\\nWe sorrowfully put Jallaluddin’s body to rest.\\n\\nMy father held my hands for a long time. There were no\\ntears in his eyes either. “Do you not see, Abul, how the Lord\\nlengthens the shadows? Had it been His will, He could have\\nmade  them  constant.  But  He  makes  the  sun  their  guide,\\nlittle by little He shortens them. It is He who has made the\\nnight  a  mantle  for  you,  and  sleep  a  rest.  Jallaluddin  has\\ngone  into  a  long  sleep—a  dreamless  sleep,  a  complete\\nrest of all his being within simple unconsciousness. Nothing\\nwill  befall  us  except  what  Allah  has  ordained.  He  is  our\\nGuardian. In Allah, my son, put your trust.” He slowly closed\\nhis wrinkled eyelids and went into a trance-like state.\\n\\nDeath has never frightened me. After all, everyone has\\nto  go  one  day.  But  perhaps  Jallaluddin  went  a  little  too\\nearly,  a  little  too  soon.  I  could  not  bring  myself  to  stay  for\\nlong at home. I felt the whole of my inner self drowning in a\\nsort  of  anxious  agitation,  and  inner  conflicts  between  my\\npersonal and my professional life. For many days, back in\\nThumba, I felt a sense of futility I had never known before—\\nabout everything I was doing.\\n\\nI had long talks with Prof. Dhawan. He told me that my\\nprogress  on  the  SLV  project  would  bring  me  solace.  The\\nconfusion  would  first  lessen  and  would  later  pass  away\\naltogether.  He  drew  my  attention  to  the  wonders  of\\ntechnology and its achievements.\\n\\nGradually,  the  hardware  began  emerging  from  the\\ndrawing boards. Sasi Kumar built a very effective network\\nof  fabrication  work  centres.  Within  days  of  getting  a\\ncomponent  drawing,  he  would  embark  on  the  fabrication\\nwith  what  was  available.  Namboodiri  and  Pillai  were\\nspending their days and nights at the propulsion laboratory\\ndeveloping  four  rocket  motors  simultaneously.  MSR  Dev\\nand Sandlas drew up meticulous plans for mechanical and\\nelectrical  integration  of  the  vehicle.  Madhavan  Nair  and\\nMurthy  examined  the  systems  developed  by  the  VSSC\\nelectronics  laboratories  and  engineered  them  into  flight\\nsub- systems wherever it was possible. US Singh brought\\nup the first launch ground system, comprising of telemetry,\\ntele-command, and radar. He also chalked out a detailed\\nwork  plan  with  SHAR  for  the  flight  trials.  Dr  Sundararajan\\nclosely  monitored  mission  objectives  and  concurrently\\nupdated  the  systems.  Dr  Srinivasan,  a  competent  launch\\nvehicle  designer,  discharged  all  my  complementary  and\\nsupplementary \\nthe  SLV  deputy  project\\ndirector.  He  noticed  what  I  had  overlooked,  heard  the\\n\\nfunctions  as \\n\\n\\x0cpoints I failed to listen to, and suggested possibilities that I\\nhad not so much as visualized.\\n\\nWe  learned  the  hard  way  that  the  biggest  problem  of\\nproject  management  is  to  achieve  a  regular  and  efficient\\ninterfacing  between  the  different  individuals  and  work\\ncentres. Hard work can be set at nought in the absence of\\nproper coordination.\\n\\nI  had  the  fortune  of  having  YS  Rajan  from  the  ISRO\\nheadquarters as my friend in those times. Rajan was (and\\nis)  a  universal  friend.  His  friendship  embraced  with  equal\\nwarmth  turners,  fitters,  electricians  and  drivers  as  well  as\\nscientists,  engineers,  contractors  and  bureaucrats.  Today\\nwhen the press calls me a ‘welder of people’, I attribute this\\nto  Rajan.  His  close  interaction  with  different  work  centres\\ncreated such a harmony in SLV affairs that the fine threads\\nof individual efforts were woven into a mighty fabric of great\\nstrength.\\n\\nIn 1976, my father passed away. He had been in poor\\nhealth for quite some time due to his advanced age. The\\ndeath of Jallaluddin had also taken a toll on his health and\\nspirit. He had lost his desire to live, as though after seeing\\nJallaluddin return to his divine source, he too had become\\neager to return to his.\\n\\nWhenever I learnt about my father’s indifferent health, I\\nwould  visit  Rameswaram  with  a  good  city  doctor.  Every\\ntime  I  did  so,  he  would  chide  me  for  my  unnecessary\\nconcern  and  lecture  me  on  the  expenses  incurred  on  the\\ndoctor. “Your visit is enough for me to get well, why bring a\\ndoctor and spend money on his fees?” he would ask. This\\ntime  he  had  gone  beyond  the  capabilities  of  any  doctor,\\ncare or money. My father Jainulabdeen, who had lived on\\nRameswaram  island  for  102  years,  had  passed  away\\nleaving \\none\\ngreatgrandson. He had led an exemplary life. Sitting alone,\\non the night after the burial, I remembered a poem written\\non the death of Yeats by his friend Auden, and felt as if it\\nwas written for my father:\\n\\ngrandchildren \\n\\nbehind \\n\\nfifteen \\n\\nand \\n\\nEarth, receive an honoured guest;\\n\\nWilliam Yeats is laid to rest:\\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nIn the prison of his daysTeach the\\nfree man how to praise.\\n\\nIn worldly terms, it was the death of just another old man.\\nNo public mourning was organized, no flags were lowered\\nto half-mast, no newspaper carried an obituary for him. He\\nwas not a politician, a scholar, or a businessman. He was a\\nplain and transparent man. My father pursued the supreme\\nvalue, the Good. His life inspired the growth of all that was\\nbenign and angelic, wise and noble.\\n\\nMy  father  had  always  reminded  me  of  the  legendary\\nAbou  Ben  Adhem  who,  waking  one  night  from  a  deep\\ndream of peace, saw an angel writing in a book of gold the\\nnames of those who love the Lord. Abou asked the Angel if\\nhis  own  name  was  on  the  list.  The  Angel  replied  in  the\\nnegative. Disappointed but still cheerful, Abou said, “Write\\nmy name down as one that loves his fellowmen”. The angel\\nwrote, and vanished. The next night, it came again with a\\ngreat  wakening  light,  and  showed  the  names  of  those\\nwhom the love of God had blessed. And Abou’s name was\\nthe first on the list.\\n\\nI sat for a long time with my mother, but could not speak.\\nShe blessed me in a choked voice when I took leave of her\\nto return to Thumba. She knew that she was not to leave the\\nhouse of her husband, of which she was the custodian, and\\nI was not to live with her there. Both of us had to live out our\\n\\n\\x0cown  destinies.  Was  I  too  stubborn  or  was  I  excessively\\npreoccupied with the SLV? Should I not have forgotten for a\\nwhile  my  own  affairs  in  order  to  listen  to  her?  I  regretfully\\nrealised this only when she passed away soon afterwards.\\nThe  SLV-3  Apogee  rocket,  developed  as  a  common\\nupper stage with Diamont, scheduled to be flight tested in\\nFrance was mired in a series of knotty problems. I had to\\nrush to France to sort them out. Before I could depart, late\\nin the afternoon, I was informed that my mother had passed\\naway. I took the first available bus to Nagarcoil. From there,\\nI  travelled  to  Rameswaram  spending  a  whole  night  in  the\\ntrain and performed the last rites the next morning. Both the\\npeople  who  had  formed  me  had  left  for  their  heavenly\\nabode. The departed had reached the end of their journey.\\nThe rest of us had to continue walking the weary road and\\nlife  had  to  go  on.  I  prayed  in  the  mosque  my  father  had\\nonce taken me to every evening. I told Him that my mother\\ncould not have lived longer in the world without the care and\\nlove  of  her  husband,  and  therefore  had  preferred  to  join\\nhim. I begged His forgiveness. “They carried out the task I\\ndesigned for them with great care, dedication and honesty\\nand came back to me. Why are you mourning their day of\\naccomplishment? Concentrate on the assignments that lie\\nbefore  you,  and  proclaim  my  glory  through  your  deeds!”\\nNobody had said these words, but I heard them loud and\\nclear. An inspiring aphorism in the Qur’an on the passing\\naway of souls filled my mind: “Your wealth and children are\\nonly  a  temptation  whereas:  Allah!  with  Him  is  an  eternal\\naward.” I came out of the mosque with my mind at peace\\nand  proceeded  to  the  railway  station.  I  always  remember\\nthat  when  the  call  for  namaz  sounded,  our  home  would\\ntransform  into  a  small  mosque.  My  father  and  my  mother\\nleading, and their children and grandchildren following.\\n\\nThe  next  morning  I  was  back  at  Thumba,  physically\\nexhausted,  emotionally  shattered,  but  determined  to  fulfill\\nour ambition of flying an Indian rocket motor on foreign soil.\\nOn my return from France, after successfully testing the\\nSLV-3 apogee motor, Dr Brahm Prakash informed me one\\nday  about  the  arrival  of  Wernher  von  Braun.  Everybody\\nworking  in  rocketry  knows  of  von  Braun,  who  made  the\\nlethal V-2 missiles that devastated London in the Second\\nWorld War. In the final stages of the War, von Braun was\\ncaptured  by  the Allied  Forces. As  a  tribute  to  his  genius,\\nvon  Braun  was  given  a  top  position  in  the  rocketry\\nprogramme at NASA. Working for the US Army, von Braun\\nproduced the landmark Jupiter missile, which was the first\\nIRBM  with  a  3000  km  range.  When  I  was  asked  by  Dr\\nBrahm Prakash to receive von Braun at Madras and escort\\nhim to Thumba, I was naturally excited.\\n\\nfar \\n\\nThe  V-2  missile  (an  abbreviation  of  the  German  word\\nVergeltungswaffe)  was  by \\nthe  greatest  single\\nachievement in the history of rockets and missiles. It was\\nthe  culmination  of  the  efforts  made  by  von  Braun  and  his\\nteam  in  the  VFR  (Society  for  Space  Flight)  in  the  1920s.\\nWhat had begun as a civilian effort soon became an official\\narmy one, and von Braun became the technical director of\\nthe  German  Missile  Laboratory  at  Kummersdorf.  The  first\\nV-2 missile was first tested unsuccessfully in June 1942. It\\ntoppled over on to its side and exploded. But on 16 August\\n1942,  it  became  the  first  missile  to  exceed  the  speed  of\\nsound.  Under  the  supervision  of  von  Braun,  more  than\\n10,000  V-2  missiles  were  produced  between  April  and\\nOctober 1944 at the gigantic underground production unit\\nnear  Nordhausen  in  Germany.  That  I  would  be  travelling\\nwith  this  man—a  scientist,  a  designer,  a  production\\nengineer, an administrator, a technology manager all rolled\\n\\n\\x0cinto one—what more could I have asked for?\\n\\nWe  flew  in  an  Avro  aircraft  which  took  around  ninety\\nminutes from Madras to Trivandrum. von Braun asked me\\nabout  our  work  and  listened  as  if  he  was  just  another\\nstudent of rocketry. I never expected the father of modern\\nrocketry  to  be  so  humble,  receptive  and  encouraging.  He\\nmade  me  feel  comfortable  right  through  the  flight.  It  was\\nhard  to  imagine  that  I  was  talking  to  a  giant  of  missile\\nsystems, as he was so self-effacing.\\n\\nHe observed that the length to diameter L/D ratio of the\\nSLV3, which was designed to be 22 was on the higher side\\nand  cautioned  me  about  the  aero-elastic  problems  which\\nmust be avoided during flight.\\n\\nHaving  spent  the  major  part  of  his  working  life  in\\nGermany, how did he feel in America? I asked this of von\\nBraun  who  had  become  a  cult  figure  in  the  States  after\\ncreating the Saturn rocket in the Apollo mission which put\\nman  on  the  moon.  “America  is  a  country  of  great\\npossibilities,  but  they  look  upon  everything  un-American\\nwith  suspicion  and  contempt.  They  suffer  from  a  deep-\\nrooted  NIH—Not  Invented  Here—complex  and  look  down\\non alien technologies. If you want to do anything in rocketry,\\ndo  it  yourself,”  von  Braun  advised  me.  He  commented,\\n“SLV-3 is a genuine Indian design and you may be having\\nyour own troubles. But you should always remember that we\\ndon’t just build on successes, we also build on failures.”\\n\\nOn the topic of the inevitable hard work that goes with\\nrocket  development  and \\nthe  degree  of  commitment\\ninvolved, he smiled and said with a glint of mischief in his\\neyes, “Hard work is not enough in rocketry. It is not a sport\\nwhere  mere  hard  work  can  fetch  you  honours.  Here,  not\\nonly  do  you  have  to  have  a  goal  but  you  have  to  have\\nstrategies to achieve it as fast as possible.”\\n\\n“Total  commitment  is  not  just  hard  work,  it  is  total\\ninvolvement.  Building  a  rock  wall  is  back-breaking  work.\\nThere are some people who build rock walls all their lives.\\nAnd  when  they  die,  there  are  miles  of  walls,  mute\\ntestimonials to how hard those people had worked.”\\n\\nHe  continued,  “But  there  are  other  men  who  while\\nplacing  one  rock  on  top  of  another  have  a  vision  in  their\\nminds, a goal. It may be a terrace with roses climbing over\\nthe rock walls and chairs set out for lazy summer days. Or\\nthe  rock  wall  may  enclose  an  apple  orchard  or  mark  a\\nboundary. When they finish, they have more than a wall. It is\\nthe goal that makes the difference. Do not make rocketry\\nyour profession, your livelihood— make it your religion, your\\nmission.” Did I see something of Prof. Vikram Sarabhai in\\nvon Braun? It made me happy to think so.\\n\\nWith three deaths in the family in as many successive\\nyears,  I  needed  total  commitment  to  my  work  in  order  to\\nkeep  performing.  I  wanted  to  throw  all  my  being  into  the\\ncreation of the SLV. I felt as if I had discovered the path I\\nwas meant to follow, God’s mission for me and my purpose\\non  His  earth.  During  this  period,  it  was  as  though  I  had\\npushed  a  hold  button—no  badminton  in  the  evenings,  no\\nmore  weekends  or  holidays,  no  family,  no  relations,  not\\neven any friends outside the SLV circle.\\n\\nTo  succeed  in  your  mission,  you  must  have  single-\\nminded  devotion  to  your  goal.  Individuals  like  myself  are\\noften called ‘workaholics’. I question this term because that\\nimplies  a  pathological  condition  or  an  illness.  If  I  do  that\\nwhich  I  desire  more  than  anything  else  in  the  world  and\\nwhich  makes  me  happy,  such  work  can  never  be  an\\naberration.  Words  from  the  twenty-sixth  Psalm  come  to\\nmind while I work: “Examine me, O Lord, and prove me.”\\n\\n\\x0cthey \\n\\nfound \\n\\nTotal commitment is a crucial quality for those who want\\nto reach the very top of their profession. The desire to work\\nat  optimum  capacity  leaves  hardly  any  room  for  anything\\nelse. I have had people with me who would scoff at the 40-\\nhours-a-week  job  they  were  being  paid  for.  I  have  known\\nothers  who  used  to  work  60,  80  and  even  100  hours  a\\nweek  because \\ntheir  work  exciting  and\\nrewarding. Total commitment is the common denominator\\namong  all  successful  men  and  women.  Are  you  able  to\\nmanage  the  stresses  you  encounter  in  your  life?  The\\ndifference between an energetic and a confused person is\\nthe  difference \\ntheir\\nexperiences.  Man  needs  his  difficulties  because  they  are\\nnecessary to enjoy success. All of us carry some sort of a\\nsuper-intelligence within us. Let it be stimulated to enable\\nus to examine our deepest thoughts, desires, and beliefs.\\n\\ntheir  minds  handle \\n\\nthe  way \\n\\nin \\n\\nOnce you have done this—charged yourself, as it were,\\nwith  your  commitment  to  your  work—you  also  need  good\\nhealth and boundless energy. Climbing to the top demands\\nstrength, whether to the top of Mount Everest or to the top of\\nyour career. People are born with different energy reserves\\nand the one who tires first and burns out easily will do well\\nto reorganize his or her life at the earliest.\\n\\nIn  1979,  a  six-member  team  was  preparing  the  flight\\nversion of a complex second stage control system for static\\ntest and evaluation. The team was in countdown mode at T-\\n15 minutes (15 minutes before the test). One of the twelve\\nvalves did not respond during checkout. Anxiety drove the\\nmembers  of  the  team  to  the  test  site  to  look  into  the\\nproblem. Suddenly the oxidizer tank, filled with red fuming\\nnitric acid (RFNA), burst, causing severe acid burns to the\\nteam members. It was a very traumatic experience to see\\nthe  suffering  of  the  injured.  Kurup  and  I  rushed  to  the\\nTrivandrum Medical College Hospital and begged to have\\nour colleagues admitted, as six beds were not available in\\nthe hospital at that point of time.\\n\\nSivaramakrishnan Nair was one among the six persons\\ninjured.  The  acid  had  burned  his  body  at  a  number  of\\nplaces. By the time we got a bed in the hospital, he was in\\nsevere pain. I kept vigil at his bedside. Around 3 o’ clock in\\nthe  morning,  Sivarama-krishnan  regained  consciousness.\\nHis  first  words  expressed  regret  over  the  mishap  and\\nassured  me  that  he  would  make  up  the  slippage  in\\nschedules  caused  by  the  accident.  His  sincerity  and\\noptimism, even in the midst of such severe pain, impressed\\nme deeply.\\n\\nMen like Sivaramakrishnan are a breed apart. They are\\nthe strivers, always reaching higher than the last time. And\\nwith their social and family life welded to their dream, they\\nfind the rewards of their drive overwhelming—the inherent\\njoy  of  being  in  flow.  This  event  greatly  enhanced  my\\nconfidence in my team; a team that would stand like a rock\\nin success and failure.\\n\\nI have used the word ‘flow’ at many places without really\\nelaborating  its  meaning.  What  is  this  flow? And  what  are\\nthese joys? I could call them moments of magic. I see an\\nanalogy  between  these  moments  and  the  high  that  you\\nexperience when you play badminton or go jogging. Flow is\\na  sensation  we  experience  when  we  act  with  total\\ninvolvement. During flow, action follows action according to\\nan  internal  logic  that  seems  to  need  no  conscious\\nintervention  on  the  part  of  the  worker.  There  is  no  hurry;\\nthere  are  no  distracting  demands  on  one’s  attention.  The\\npast  and  the  future  disappear.  So  does  the  distinction\\nbetween  self  and  the  activity.  We  had  all  come  under  the\\ncurrent  of  the  SLV  flow.  Although  we  were  working  very\\n\\n\\x0chard we were very relaxed, energetic and fresh. How did it\\nhappen? Who had created this flow?\\n\\nPerhaps  it  was  the  meaningful  organization  of  the\\npurposes  we  sought  to  achieve.  We  would  identify  the\\nbroadest  possible  purpose  level  and  then  work  towards\\ndeveloping  a  feasible  target  solution  from  a  variety  of\\nalternatives.  It  was  this  working  backwards  to  develop  a\\ncreative change in the problem solution, that used to put us\\nin ‘flow’.\\n\\nWhen the SLV-3 hardware started emerging, our ability\\nto  concentrate  increased  markedly.  I  felt  a  tremendous\\nsurge  of  confidence;  in  complete  control  over  myself  and\\nover the SLV-3 project. Flow is a by-product of controlled\\ncreativity. The first requirement is to work as hard as you\\ncan  at  something  that  presents  a  challenge  and  is\\napproved  by  your  heart.  It  may  not  be  an  overwhelming\\nchallenge, but one that stretches you a little, something that\\nmakes  you  realise  that  you  are  performing  a  task  better\\ntoday than you did yesterday, or the last time you tried to do\\nit. Another prerequisite for being in flow is the availability of\\na significant span of uninterrupted time. In my experience, it\\nis  difficult  to  switch  into  the  flow  state  in  less  than  half  an\\nhour. And it is almost impossible if you are bedevilled by\\ninterruptions.\\n\\nIs it possible to switch yourself into flow by using some\\nsort of a conditioning device in much the same way that we\\ncondition ourselves to learn effectively? The answer is yes,\\nand the secret is to analyse previous occasions when you\\nhave  been  in  flow,  because  each  person  has  his  or  her\\nunique  natural  frequency  which  responds  to  a  particular\\nstimulus. You alone can identify the common denominator\\nin  your  case.  Once  you  have  isolated  this  common\\ndenominator, you can set the stage for flow.\\n\\nI have experienced this state many times, almost every\\nday  of  the  SLV  mission.  There  have  been  days  in  the\\nlaboratory  when  I  have  looked  up  to  find  the  laboratory\\nempty and realised that it was way past the quitting time.\\nOn  other  days,  my  team  members  and  I  have  been  so\\ncaught up in our work that the lunch hour slipped by without\\nour even being conscious that we were hungry.\\n\\nAnalysing  such  occasions  in  retrospect,  I  find  them\\nsimilar in the sense that this flow was experienced when the\\nproject  was  nearing  completion,  or  when  the  project  had\\nreached that phase when all the necessary data had been\\ngathered  and  we  were  ready  to  start  summing  up  the\\nproblem, outlining the demands made by conflicting criteria\\nand the various positions presented by opposing interests\\nand making our recommendations for action. I also realised\\nthat this tended to happen on days that were relatively quiet\\nin  the  office,  with  no  crises  or  meetings.  Such  spells\\nincreased steadily in frequency, and the SLV-3 dream was\\nfinally realised in the middle of 1979.\\n\\nWe  had  scheduled  the  first  experimental  flight  trial  of\\nSLV-3  for  10  August  1979.  The  primary  goals  of  the\\nmission were to realise a fully integrated launch vehicle; to\\nevaluate  on-board  systems  like  stage  motors,  guidance\\nand  control  systems  and  electronic  subsystems;  and  to\\nevaluate ground systems, like checkout, tracking, telemetry\\nand real-time data facilities in launch operations built at the\\nSriharikota launch complex. The 23 metre-long, four-stage\\nSLV rocket weighing 17 tonnes finally took off elegantly at\\n0758  hours  and \\nits\\nprogrammed trajectory.\\n\\nimmediately  started \\n\\nfollowing \\n\\nStage  I  performed  to  perfection.  There  was  a  smooth\\ntransition  from  this  stage  to  the  second  stage.  We  were\\n\\n\\x0cspellbound to see our hopes flying in the form of the SLV-3.\\nSuddenly, the spell was broken. The second stage went out\\nof control. The flight was terminated after 317 seconds and\\nthe  vehicle’s  remains,  including  my  favourite  fourth  stage\\nwith  the  payload  splashed  into  the  sea,  560  km  off\\nSriharikota.\\n\\nThe incident caused us profound disappointment. I felt a\\nstrange mix of anger and frustration. Suddenly, I felt my legs\\nbecome so stiff that they ached. The problem was not with\\nmy body; something was happening in my mind.\\n\\nThe  premature  death  of  my  hovercraft  Nandi,  the\\nabandoning of the RATO, the abortion of the SLV-Diamont\\nfourth  stage—all  came  alive  in  a  flash,  like  a  long-buried\\nPhoenix  rising  from  its  ashes.  Over  the  years,  I  had\\nsomehow  learned  to  absorb  these  aborted  endeavours,\\nhad  come  to  terms  with  them  and  pursued  fresh  dreams.\\nThat  day,  I  re-lived  each  of  those  setbacks  in  my  deep\\ndespondency.\\n\\n“What  do  you  suppose  could  be  the  cause  of  it?”\\nsomebody asked me in the Block House. I tried to find an\\nanswer, but I was too tired to try and think it out, and gave\\nup the effort as futile. The launch was conducted in the early\\nmorning, preceded by a full night’s count-down. Moreover, I\\nhad  hardly  had  any  sleep  in  the  past  week.  Completely\\ndrained—mentally as well as physically—I went straight to\\nmy room and slumped onto the bed.\\n\\nA gentle touch on my shoulder woke me up. It was late\\nin  the  afternoon,  almost  approaching  evening.  I  saw  Dr\\nBrahm Prakash sitting by my bedside. “What about going\\nfor lunch?” he asked. I was deeply touched by his affection\\nand concern. I found out later that Dr Brahm Prakash had\\ncome to my room twice before that but had gone away on\\nfinding me asleep. He had waited all that time for me to get\\nup and have lunch with him. I was sad, but not alone. The\\ncompany  of  Dr  Brahm  Prakash  filled  me  with  a  new\\nconfidence.  He  made  light  conversation  during  the  meal,\\ncarefully  avoiding  the  SLV-3,  but  gently  providing  me\\nsolace.\\n* * *\\n\\n\\x0c9\\n\\n\\x0cBuilders\\n\\nDr  Brahm  Prakash  helped  me  endure  this  difficult\\nperiod. In practice, Dr Brahm Prakash employed the front-\\nline  damage  control  principle:  “Just  get  the  fellow  home\\nalive.  He’ll  recover.”  He  drew  the  entire  SLV  team  close\\nand demonstrated to me that I was not alone in my sorrow\\nat the SLV-3’s failure. “All your comrades are standing by\\nyou,”  he  said.  This  gave  me  vital  emotional  support,\\nencouragement, and guidance.\\n\\nA post-flight review conducted on 11 August 1979 was\\nattended  by  more  than  seventy  scientists.  A  detailed\\ntechnical appraisal of the failure was completed. Later, the\\npost-flight  analysis  committee  headed  by  SK  Athithan\\npinpointed the reasons for the malfunction of the vehicle. It\\nwas established that the mishap occurred because of the\\nfailure of the second stage control system. No control force\\nwas available during the second stage flight due to which\\nthe  vehicle  became  aerodynamically  unstable,  resulting  in\\naltitude and velocity loss. This caused the vehicle to fall into\\nthe sea even before the other stages could ignite.\\n\\nFurther  in-depth  analysis  of  the  second-stage  failure\\nidentified the reason as the draining of a good amount of\\nRed Fuming Nitric Acid (RFNA) used as the oxidizer for the\\nfuel  power  at  that  stage.  Consequently,  when  the  control\\nforce  was  demanded,  only  fuel  was  injected  resulting  in\\nzero force. ‘A solenoid valve in the oxidizer tank remaining\\nopen due to contamination after the first command at T-8\\nminutes’,  was  identified  as  the  reason  for  the  draining  of\\nRFNA.\\n\\nThe  findings  were  presented  to  Prof.  Dhawan  at  a\\nmeeting  of  top  ISRO  scientists  and  were  accepted.\\nEverybody  was  convinced  by  the  technical  cause-and-\\neffect sequence presented and there was a general feeling\\nfailure-\\nof  satisfaction  about \\nmanagement  measures  taken.  I  was  still  unconvinced\\nthough and felt restless. To me, the level of responsibility is\\nmeasured by one’s ability to confront the decision-making\\nprocess without any delay or distraction.\\n\\nthe  whole  exercise  of \\n\\nOn the spur of the moment, I stood up and addressed\\nProf. Dhawan, “Sir, even though my friends have technically\\njustified the failure, I take the responsibility for judging the\\nRFNA leak detected during the final phase of countdown as\\ninsignificant. As  a  Mission  Director,  I  should  have  put  the\\nlaunch on hold and saved the flight if possible. In a similar\\nsituation abroad, the Mission Director would have lost his\\njob. I therefore take responsibility for the SLV-3 failure.” For\\nquite some time there was pin-drop silence in the hall. Then\\nProf. Dhawan got up and said, “I am going to put Kalam in\\norbit!”,  and  left  the  place  signalling  that  the  meeting  was\\nover.\\n\\nThe pursuit of science is a combination of great elation\\nand great despair. I went over many such episodes in my\\nmind. Johannes Kepler, whose three orbital laws form the\\nbasis  of  space  research,  took  nearly  17  years  after\\nformulating the two laws about planetary motion around the\\nsun,  to  enunciate  his  third  law  which  gives  the  relation\\nbetween the size of the elliptical orbit and the length of time\\nit  takes  for  the  planet  to  go  around  the  sun.  How  many\\nfailures  and  frustrations  must  he  have  gone  through?  The\\nidea  that  man  could  land  on  the  moon,  developed  by  the\\nRussian  mathematician  Konstantin  Tsiolkovsky,  was\\nrealised  after  nearly  four  decades—and  by  the  United\\nStates, at that. Prof. Chandrasekhar had to wait nearly 50\\nyears before receiving the Nobel Prize for his discovery of\\n\\n\\x0cthe ‘Chandrasekhar Limit’, a discovery made while he was\\na graduate student at Cambridge in the 1930s. If his work\\nhad  been  recognized  then,  it  could  have  led  to  the\\ndiscovery  of  the  Black  Hole  decades  earlier.  How  many\\nfailures  must  von  Braun  have  gone  through  before  his\\nSaturn  launch  vehicle  put  man  on  the  moon?  These\\nthoughts  helped  to  give  me  the  ability  to  withstand\\napparently irreversible setbacks.\\n\\nin \\n\\nEarly in November 1979, Dr Brahm Prakash retired. He\\nhad always been my sheet-anchor in the turbulent waters of\\nVSSC.  His  belief \\nthe\\nmanagement  pattern  for  the  SLV  project,  which  later\\nbecame a blueprint for all scientific projects in the country.\\nDr  Brahm  Prakash  was  a  very  wise  counsellor  who  gave\\nme  valuable  guidance  whenever  I  deviated  from  my\\nmission objectives.\\n\\nteam  spirit  had \\n\\ninspired \\n\\nDr Brahm Prakash not only reinforced the traits which I\\nhad acquired from Prof. Sarabhai, but also helped me give\\nthem  new  dimensions.  He  always  cautioned  me  against\\nhaste.  “Big  scientific  projects  are  like  mountains,  which\\nshould  be  climbed  with  as  little  effort  as  possible  and\\nwithout  urgency.  The  reality  of  your  own  nature  should\\ndetermine your speed. If you become restless, speed up. If\\nyou become tense and highstrung, slow down. You should\\nclimb  the  mountain  in  a  state  of  equilibrium.  When  each\\ntask  of  your  project  is  not  just  a  means  to  an  end  but  a\\nunique event in itself, then you are doing it well,” he would\\ntell me. The echo of Dr Brahm Prakash’s advice could be\\nheard in Emerson’s poem on Brahma:\\nIf the red slayer think he slays,\\n\\nOr, if the slain think he is slain,\\nThey know not well, the subtle ways\\nI keep, and pass, and turn again.\\n\\nTo live only for some unknown future is superficial. It is\\nlike  climbing  a  mountain  to  reach  the  peak  without\\nexperiencing  its  sides.  The  sides  of  the  mountain  sustain\\nlife, not the peak. This is where things grow, experience is\\ngained, and technologies are mastered. The importance of\\nthe peak lies only in the fact that it defines the sides. So I\\nwent on towards the top, but always experiencing the sides.\\nI had a long way to go but I was in no hurry. I went in little\\nsteps—just one step after another—but each step towards\\nthe top.\\n\\nAt every stage, the SLV-3 team was blessed with some\\nextraordinarily  courageous  people.  Along  with  Sudhakar\\nand Sivaramakrishnan, there was also Sivakaminathan. He\\nwas  entrusted  with  bringing  the  C-Band  transponder  from\\nTrivandrum  to  SHAR  for  integration  with  the  SLV-3.  The\\ntransponder is a device fitted with the rocket system to give\\nthe radar signals which are powerful enough to help it track\\nthe  vehicle  from  the  take-off  site  to  the  final  impact  point.\\nThe SLV-3 launch schedule was dependent on the arrival\\nand integration of this equipment. On landing at the Madras\\nairport,  the  aircraft  which  Sivakami  was  travelling  in\\nskidded and overshot the runway. Dense smoke engulfed\\nthe  aircraft.  Everyone  jumped  out  of  the  aircraft  through\\nemergency  exits,  and  desperately \\nto  save\\nthemselves—all except Sivakami, who stayed in the aircraft\\ntill he removed the transponder from his baggage. He was\\namong the last few persons, the others being mostly aircraft\\ncrew, to emerge from the smoke and he was hugging the\\ntransponder close to his chest.\\n\\nfought \\n\\nAnother  incident  from  those  days  that  I  recall  clearly\\nrelates  to  Prof.  Dhawan’s  visit  to  the  SLV-3  assembly\\nbuilding.  Prof.  Dhawan,  Madhavan  Nair  and  I  were\\n\\n\\x0cdiscussing  some  finer  aspects  of  the  SLV-3  integration.\\nThe  vehicle  was  kept  on  the  launcher  in  a  horizontal\\nposition. When we were moving around and examining the\\nreadiness  of  the  integrated  hardware,  I  noticed  the\\npresence of big water-ports for extinguishing fire in case of\\nan  accident.  For  some  reason,  I  felt  uncomfortable  at  the\\nsight  of  the  ports  facing  the  SLV-3  on  the  launcher.  I\\nsuggested to Madhavan Nair that we could rotate the port\\nso that they were apart by a full 180o. This would prevent\\nthe freak possibility of water gushing out and damaging the\\nrocket.  To  our  surprise,  within  minutes  of  Madhavan  Nair\\ngetting the ports reversed, powerful water jets gushed out\\nof  the  ports.  The  Vehicle  Safety  Officer  had  ensured  the\\nfunctioning of the fire-fighting system without realising that it\\ncould have wrecked the entire rocket. This was a lesson in\\nforesight. Or did we have divine protection?\\n\\nOn  17  July  1980,  30  hours  before  the  launch  of  the\\nsecond SLV-3, the newspapers were filled with all kinds of\\npredictions. One of the newspapers reported, “The Project\\nDirector  is  missing  and  could  not  be  contacted.”  Many\\nreports preferred to trace the history of the first SLV3 flight,\\nand  recalled  how  the  third  stage  had  failed  to  ignite\\nbecause of lack of fuel and the rocket had nosedived into\\nthe  ocean.  Some  highlighted  SLV-3’s  possible  military\\nimplications in terms of acquiring the capability for building\\nIRBMs. Some were a general prognosis of all that ailed our\\ncountry  and  related  it  to  the  SLV-3.  I  knew  that  the  next\\nday’s  launch  was  going  to  decide  the  future  of  the  Indian\\nspace programme. In fact, to put it simply, the eyes of the\\nwhole nation were on us.\\n\\nIn the early hours of the next day, 18 July 1980—at 0803\\nhrs  to  be  precise,  India’s  first  Satellite  Launch  Vehicle,\\nSLV-3 lifted off from SHAR. At 600 seconds before take-\\noff,  I  saw  the  computer  displaying  data  about  stage  IV\\ngiving the required velocity to the Rohini Satellite (carried\\nas payload) to enter its orbit. Within the next two minutes,\\nRohini was set into motion in a low earth orbit. I spoke, in\\nthe midst of screeching decibels, the most important words\\nI  had  ever  uttered  in  my  life,  “Mission  Director  calling  all\\nstations.  Stand  by  for  an  important  announcement.  All\\nstages  performed  to  mission  requirements.  The  fourth\\nstage apogee motor has given the required velocity to put\\nRohini  Satellite  into  orbit”.  There  were  happy  cries\\neverywhere.  When  I  came  out  of  the  Block  House,  I  was\\nlifted  onto  the  shoulders  of  my  jubilant  colleagues  and\\ncarried in a procession.\\n\\nThe whole nation was excited. India had made its entry\\ninto  the  small  group  of  nations  which  possessed  satellite\\nlaunch capability. Newspapers carried news of the event in\\ntheir headlines. Radio and television stations aired special\\nprogrammes. Parliament greeted the achievement with the\\nthumping of desks. It was both the culmination of a national\\ndream, and the beginning of a very important phase in our\\nnation’s  history.  Prof.  Satish  Dhawan,  Chairman  ISRO,\\nthrew  his  customary  guardedness  to  the  winds  and\\nannounced that it was now well within our ability to explore\\nspace.  Prime  Minister \\nIndira  Gandhi  cabled  her\\ncongratulations. But the most important reaction was that of\\nthe  Indian  scientific  community—everybody  was  proud  of\\nthis hundred per cent indigenous effort.\\n\\nI  experienced  mixed  feelings.  I  was  happy  to  achieve\\nthe success which had been evading me for the past two\\ndecades,  but  I  was  sad  because  the  people  who  had\\ninspired  me  were  no  longer  there  to  share  my  joy—my\\nfather, my brother-in-law Jallaluddin, and Prof. Sarabhai.\\n\\nThe credit for the successful SLV-3 flight goes, first, to\\n\\n\\x0cthe giants of the Indian space programme, Prof. Sarabhai\\nin  particular,  who  had  preceded  this  effort;  next  to  the\\nhundreds of VSSC personnel who had through sheer will-\\npower  proved  the  mettle  of  our  countrymen  and  also,  not\\nleast, to Prof. Dhawan and Dr Brahm Prakash, who had led\\nthe project.\\n\\nWe  had  a  late  dinner  that  evening.  Gradually,  the  din\\nand clatter of the celebrations calmed down. I retired to my\\nbed with almost no energy left. Through the open window, I\\ncould  see  the  moon  among  the  clouds.  The  sea  breeze\\nseemed to reflect the buoyancy of the mood on Sriharikota\\nisland that day.\\n\\nWithin a month of the SLV-3 success, I visited the Nehru\\nScience  Centre  in  Bombay  for  a  day,  in  response  to  an\\ninvitation to share my experiences with the SLV-3. There, I\\nreceived  a  telephone  call  from  Prof.  Dhawan  in  Delhi,\\nasking me to join him the next morning. We were to meet\\nthe  Prime  Minister,  Mrs  Indira  Gandhi.  My  hosts  at  the\\nNehru  Centre  were  kind  enough  to  arrange  my  ticket  to\\nDelhi,  but  I  had  a  small  problem.  It  had  to  do  with  my\\nclothes. I was dressed casually as is my wont and wearing\\nslippers—not, by any standards of etiquette, suitable attire\\nin  which  to  meet  the  Prime  Minister!  When  I  told  Prof.\\nDhawan about this problem, he told me not to worry about\\nmy dress. “You are beautifully clothed in your success,” he\\nquipped.\\n\\nProf.  Dhawan  and  I  arrived  at  the  Parliament  House\\nAnnexe  the  next  morning. A  meeting  of  the  Parliamentary\\nPanel  on  Science  &  Technology  chaired  by  the  Prime\\nMinister was scheduled. There were about 30 Members of\\nthe Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha in the room, which was lit\\nby  a  majestic  chandelier.  Prof.  MGK  Menon  and  Dr  Nag\\nChaudhuri were also present. Shrimati Gandhi spoke to the\\nMembers about the success of the SLV-3 and lauded our\\nachievement.  Prof.  Dhawan  thanked  the  gathering  for  the\\nencouragement  given  by  them  to  space  research  in  the\\ncountry and expressed the gratitude of the ISRO scientists\\nand engineers. Suddenly, I saw Shrimati Gandhi smiling at\\nme as she said, “Kalam! We would like to hear you speak.”\\nI  was  surprised  by  the  request  as  Prof.  Dhawan  had\\nalready addressed the gathering.\\n\\nHesitantly, \\n\\nI  rose  and  responded,  “I  am \\n\\nindeed\\nhonoured to be in this great gathering of nation-builders. I\\nonly know how to build a rocket system in our country, which\\nwould inject a satellite, built in our country, by imparting to it\\na  velocity  of  25,000  km  per  hour.”  There  was  thunderous\\napplause.  I  thanked  the  members  for  giving  us  an\\nopportunity to work on a project like the SLV-3 and prove\\nthe scientific strength of our country. The entire room was\\nirradiated with happiness.\\n\\nNow \\n\\nthat  Project  SLV-3  had  been  successfully\\ncompleted,  VSSC  had  to  re-organize  its  resources  and\\nredefine  its  goals.  I  wanted  to  be  relieved  of  the  project\\nactivities, and consequently Ved Prakash Sandlas from my\\nteam  was  made  the  Project  Director  for  the  SLV-3\\nContinuation  Project,  which  aimed  at  making  operational\\nsatellite  launch  vehicles  of  a  similar  class.  With  a  view  to\\nupgrade  the  SLV-3  by  means  of  certain  technological\\ninnovations, \\nthe  development  of  Augmented  Satellite\\nLaunch Vehicles (ASLVs) had been on the cards for some\\ntime.  The  aim  was  to  enhance  the  SLV-3  payload\\ncapability from 40 kg to 150 kg. MSR Dev from my team\\nwas appointed Project Director ASLV. Then, to reach the\\nsun-synchronous orbit (900 km), a PSLV was to be made.\\nThe  Geo  Satellite  Launch  Vehicle  (GSLV)  was  also\\n\\n\\x0cenvisaged,  though  as  a  distant  dream.  I  took  up  the\\nposition  of  Director,  Aerospace  Dynamics  and  Design\\nGroup,  so  that  I  could  configure  the  forthcoming  launch\\nvehicles and technology development.\\n\\nThe  existing  VSSC  infrastructure  was  inadequate  to\\nhandle  the  size  and  weight  of  the  future  launch  vehicle\\nsystems and the implementation of all these projects was\\ngoing  to  require  highly  specialized  facilities.  New  sites\\nwere  identified  for  the  expanded  activities  of  VSSC,  at\\nVattiyoorkavu  and  Valiamala.  Dr  Srinivasan  drew  up  a\\ndetailed  plan  of  the  facilities.  Meanwhile,  I  carried  out  an\\nanalysis  of  the  application  of  SLV-3  and  its  variants  with\\nSivathanu Pillai, and compared the existing launch vehicles\\nof  the  world  for  missile  applications.  We  established  that\\nthe  SLV-3  solid  rocket  systems  would  meet  the  national\\nrequirements  of  payload  delivery  vehicles  for  short  and\\nintermediate  ranges  (4000  km).  We  contended  that  the\\ndevelopment  of  one  additional  solid  booster  of  1.8  m\\ndiameter  with  36  tonnes  of  propellant  along  with  SLV-3\\nsubsystems  would  meet  the  ICBM  requirement  (above\\n5000  km  for  a  1000  kg  payload).  This  proposal  was,\\nhowever, never considered. It nevertheless paved the way\\nfor the formulation of the Re-entry Experiment (REX) which,\\nmuch later on, became Agni.\\n\\nThe  next  SLV-3  flight,  SLV3-D1,  took  off  on  31  May\\n1981. I witnessed this flight from the visitors’ gallery. This\\nwas  the  first  time  I  witnessed  a  launch  from  outside  the\\nControl Centre. The unpalatable truth I had to face was that\\nby  becoming  the  focus  of  media  attention,  I  had  aroused\\nenvy among some of my senior colleagues, all of whom had\\nequally contributed to the success of SLV-3. Was I hurt at\\nthe  coldness  of  the  new  environment?  Perhaps  yes,  but  I\\nwas willing to accept what I couldn’t change.\\n\\nI have never lived off the profits of others’ minds. My life,\\nin keeping with my nature, has never been that of a ruthless\\nforce  and\\nachiever.  The  SLV-3  was  made  not  by \\nmanipulation, but through consistent collective effort. Then\\nwhy this sense of bitterness? Was it peculiar to the VSSC\\ntop level or a universal reality? As a scientist, I was trained\\nto reason out reality. In science, reality is that which exists.\\nAnd because this bitterness was real, I had to reason it out.\\nBut can these things be reasoned out?\\n\\nWere  my  post-SLV  experiences  leading  me  into  a\\ncritical  situation?  Yes  and  no.  Yes,  because  the  glory  of\\nSLV-3  had  not  gone  to  everyone  who  deserved  it—but\\nhardly  anything  could  have  been  done  about  that.  No,\\nbecause a situation can be considered critical for a person\\nonly  when  realisation  of  the  internal  necessity  becomes\\nimpossible. And that certainly was not the case. In fact, the\\nconcept  of  conflict  is  built  upon  this  basic  idea.  In\\nretrospect, I can only say that I was fully aware of a great\\nneed for actualization and renewal.\\n\\nIn January 1981, I was invited by Dr Bhagiratha Rao of\\nthe High Altitude Laboratory (now the Defence Electronics\\nApplications  Laboratory  (DEAL)),  Dehra  Dun  to  give  a\\nlecture on the SLV-3. The renowned nuclear scientist, Prof.\\nRaja Ramanna, whom I had always admired, and who was\\nthen  the  Scientific  Adviser  to  the  Defence  Minister,\\npresided over the gathering. He spoke on India’s efforts in\\ngenerating nuclear energy and the challenge in conducting\\nthe first nuclear test for peaceful purposes. As I had been\\nso  closely  involved  with  SLV-3,  it  was  natural  that  I  was\\nsoon  in  full  spate  about  it.  Later,  Prof.  Raja  Ramanna\\ninvited me for a private meeting over tea.\\n\\nThe first thing that struck me when I met Prof. Ramanna\\nwas  his  genuine  pleasure  at  meeting  me.  There  was  an\\n\\n\\x0cin  his \\n\\ntalk,  an \\n\\neagerness \\nimmediate,  sympathetic\\nfriendliness,  accompanied  by  quick,  graceful  movements.\\nThe  evening  brought  back  memories  of  my  first  meeting\\nwith  Prof.  Sarabhai—as  if  it  was  yesterday.  The  world  of\\nProf.  Sarabhai  was  internally  simple  and  externally  easy.\\nEach of us working with him was driven by a single-minded\\nneed to create, and lived under conditions which made the\\nobject  of  that  need  directly  accessible.  Sarabhai’s  world\\nwas tailor-made to our dreams. It had neither too much nor\\ntoo  little  of  anything  needed  by  any  one  of  us.  We  could\\ndivide it by our requirements without a remainder.\\n\\nMy  world,  by  now,  had  no  simplicity  left  in  it.  It  had\\nbecome an internally complex and externally difficult world.\\nMy efforts in rocketry and in achieving the goal of making\\nindigenous  rockets  were  impeded  by  external  obstacles\\nand  complicated  by  internal  wavering.  I  was  aware  that  it\\nrequired a special effort of the will to sustain my trajectory.\\nThe  coordination  of  my  present  with  my  past  had  already\\nbeen jeopardised. The coordination of my present with my\\nfuture was uppermost in my mind when I went to have tea\\nwith Prof. Ramanna.\\n\\nHe  did  not  take  long  to  come  to  the  point.  The  Devil\\nMissile  programme  had  been  shelved \\nin  spite  of\\ntremendous  achievements  made  by  Narayanan  and  his\\nteam  at  DRDL.  The  entire  programme  of  military  rockets\\nwas reeling under a persistent apathy. The DRDO needed\\nsomebody to take command of their missile programmes\\nwhich had been stuck at the drawing board and static test\\nbed stages for quite a while. Prof. Ramanna asked me if I\\nwould like to join DRDL and shoulder the responsibility of\\nshaping  their  Guided  Missile  Development  Programme\\n(GMDP).  Prof.  Ramanna’s  proposal  evoked  a  mixture  of\\nemotions in me.\\nWhen  again  would \\nconsolidate all our knowledge of rocketry and apply it?\\n\\nI  have  such  an  opportunity \\n\\nto\\n\\nI felt honoured by the esteem in which Prof. Ramanna\\nheld  me.  He  had  been  the  guiding  spirit  behind  the\\nPokharan nuclear test, and I was thrilled by the impact he\\nhad  helped  create  on  the  outside  world  about  India’s\\ntechnical competence. I knew I would not be able to refuse\\nhim. Prof. Ramanna advised me to talk to Prof. Dhawan on\\nthis  issue  so  that  he  could  work  out  the  modalities  of  my\\ntransfer from ISRO to DRDL.\\n\\nI met Prof. Dhawan on 14 January 1981. He gave me a\\npatient  hearing,  with  his  typical  penchant  for  weighing\\neverything carefully to make sure he didn’t miss a point. A\\nmarkedly pleasant expression came to his face. He said, “I\\nam pleased with their appraisal of my man’s work”. He then\\nsmiled. I have never met anyone with a smile quite like Prof.\\nDhawan’s—a soft white cloud—you could picture it in any\\nshape you wanted to.\\n\\nfor \\n\\nthe  post  so \\n\\nthat  DRDL  could  send \\n\\nI  wondered  how  I  should  proceed.  “Should  I  formally\\napply \\nthe\\nappointment order?” I enquired of Prof. Dhawan. “No. Don’t\\npressurise them. Let me talk to the top-level management\\nduring  my  next  visit  to  New  Delhi,”  Prof.  Dhawan  said.  “I\\nknow  you  have  always  had  one  foot  in  DRDO,  now  your\\nwhole  centre  of  gravity  seems  to  have  shifted  towards\\nthem.” Perhaps what Prof. Dhawan was telling me had an\\nelement of truth in it, but my heart had always been at ISRO.\\nWas he really unaware of that?\\n\\nRepublic Day, 1981 brought with it a pleasant surprise.\\nOn  the  evening  of  25  January,  Mahadevan,  Secretary  to\\nProf. UR Rao, rang up from Delhi to inform me about the\\nHome Ministry announcement about the conferment of the\\n\\n\\x0cPadma Bhushan award on me. The next important call was\\nfrom  Prof.  Dhawan  to  congrat-ulate  me.  I  felt  blissfully\\nelated as it was from my guru. I rejoiced with Prof. Dhawan\\nat his receiving the Padma Vibhushan and I congratulated\\nhim wholeheartedly. I then rang up Dr Brahm Prakash and\\nthanked him. Dr Brahm Prakash chided me for the formality\\nand said, “I feel as if my son has got the award.” I was so\\ndeeply  touched  by  Dr  Brahm  Prakash’s  affection  that  I\\ncould no longer keep my emotions in check.\\n\\nI  filled  my  room  with  the  music  of  Bismillah  Khan’s\\nshehnai. The music took me to another time, another place.\\nI  visited  Rameswaram  and  hugged  my  mother.  My  father\\nran  his  caring  fingers  through  my  hair.  My  mentor,\\nJallaluddin, announced the news to the crowd gathered on\\nMosque Street. My sister, Zohara, prepared special sweets\\nfor  me.  Pakshi  Lakshmana  Sastry  put  a  tilak  on  my\\nforehead. Fr. Solomon blessed me holding the holy cross. I\\nsaw Prof. Sarabhai smiling with a sense of achievement—\\nthe  sapling  which  he  had  planted  twenty  years  ago  had\\nfinally  grown \\nfruits  were  being\\nappreciated by the people of India.\\n\\ntree  whose \\n\\ninto  a \\n\\nMy Padma Bhushan evoked mixed reactions at VSSC.\\nWhile  there  were  some  who  shared  my  happiness,  there\\nwere  others  who  felt  I  was  being  unduly  singled  out  for\\nrecognition. Some of my close associates turned envious.\\nWhy  do  some  people  fail  to  see  the  great  values  of  life\\nbecause  of  sadly  twisted  thought  processes?  Happiness,\\nsatisfaction, and success in life depend on making the right\\nchoices,  the  winning  choices.  There  are  forces  in  life\\nworking for you and against you. One must distinguish the\\nbeneficial  forces  from  the  malevolent  ones  and  choose\\ncorrectly between them.\\n\\nAn inner voice told me that the time had come for a long\\nfelt, but ignored, need for renewal. Let me clean my slate\\nand  write  new  ‘sums’.  Were  the  earlier  sums  done\\ncorrectly?  Evaluating  one’s  own  progress  in  life  is  not  an\\neasy task.

Many months went by,\\nand\\n\\nmany  letters  were  exchanged  between  ISRO  and\\nDRDO; and meetings were held in the secretariats of the\\nDefence R&D establishment and the Department of Space\\nto  precipitate  a  mutually  convenient  course  of  action.\\nMeanwhile,  Prof.  Ramanna  retired  from  the  office  of  the\\nScientific  Advisor \\nto  Defence  Minister.  Dr  VS\\nArunachalam, till then Director of the Defence Metallurgical\\nResearch  Laboratory  (DMRL)  in  Hyderabad,  succeeded\\nProf.  Ramanna.  Dr  Arunachalam  was  known  for  his\\nconfidence,  and  he  cared  little  for  the  intricacies  and\\nnuances  of \\nI\\nunderstand  that  the  Defence  Minister  at  that  time,  R\\nVenkataraman discussed the matter of my taking over the\\nmissile  laboratory  with  Prof.  Dhawan.  Prof.  Dhawan  also\\nseemed  to  be  waiting  for  a  decisive  step  at  the  highest\\nlevel  in  the  Defence  Ministry.  Overcoming  the  niggling\\ndoubts  that  had  caused  delays  over  the  past  year,  the\\ndecision to appoint me Director, DRDL was finally taken in\\nFebruary, 1982.\\n\\nthe  scientific  bureaucracy.  Meanwhile, \\n\\nProf.  Dhawan  used  to  visit  my  room  in  the  ISRO\\nheadquarters  and  spend  many  hours  in  evolving  space\\nlaunch vehicle projects. It was a great privilege to work with\\nsuch  a  great  scientist.  Before  I  left  ISRO,  Prof.  Dhawan\\nasked me to give a talk on the Space Programme Profile in\\nIndia  by \\nISRO\\nmanagement and staff attended my talk, which was by way\\nof a farewell meeting.\\n\\nthe  year  2000.  Almost \\n\\nthe  entire \\n\\nI  had  met  Dr  VS Arunachalam  in  1976,  when  I  visited\\nDMRL  in  connection  with  the  aluminium  alloy  investment\\ncasting for the SLV inertial guidance platform. Taking it as\\na personal challenge, Dr Arunachalam had the investment\\ncasting,  the  first  of  its  kind  in  the  country,  made  in  the\\nincredibly short time of two months. His youthful energy and\\nenthusiasm  never \\nto  amaze  me.  This  young\\nmetallurgist  had  within  a  short  span  of  time  lifted  the\\nscience of metal-making to the technology of metal-forming\\nand  then  to  the  art  of  alloy  development.  With  a  tall  and\\nelegant  figure,  Dr  Arunachalam  was  like  an  electrically\\ncharged dynamo himself. I found him an unusually friendly\\nperson  with  a  forceful  manner,  as  well  as  an  excellent\\nworking partner.\\n\\nfailed \\n\\nI visited DRDL in April 1982 to acquaint myself with my\\npotential work site. The Director of DRDL then, SL Bansal,\\ntook me around and introduced me to the senior scientists\\nin the laboratory. DRDL was working on five staff projects\\nand sixteen competence build-up projects. They were also\\ninvolved  in  several  technology-oriented  activities  with  a\\nview  to  gain  lead  time  for  the  development  of  indigenous\\nmissile  systems  in  future.  I  was  particularly  impressed  by\\ntheir  efforts  on  the  twin  30-ton  Liquid  Propellant  Rocket\\nEngine.\\n\\nMeanwhile,  Anna  University,  Madras,  conferred  the\\nhonorary degree of Doctor of Science on me. It had been\\nnearly  twenty  years  since  I  had  acquired  my  degree  in\\naeronautical engineering. I was happy that Anna University\\nhad recognized my efforts in the field of rocketry, but what\\npleased  me  most  was  the  recognition  of  the  value  of  our\\nwork  in  academic  circles.  To  my  delight,  the  honorary\\n\\n\\x0cdoctorate degree was awarded at a convocation presided\\nover by Prof. Raja Ramanna.\\n\\nI  joined  DRDL  on  1  June,  1982.  Very  soon,  I  realized\\nthat this laboratory was still haunted by the winding up of the\\nDevil missile project. Many excellent professionals had not\\nyet recovered from the disappointment. People outside the\\nscientific  world  may  find  it  difficult  to  comprehend  how  a\\nscientist  feels  when  the  umbilical  cord  to  his  work  is\\nsuddenly  snapped, \\nto  his\\nfor  reasons \\nunderstanding  and  interests.  The  general  mood  and  work\\ntempo  at  DRDL \\nreminded  me  of  Samuel  Taylor\\nColeridge’s poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner:\\n\\ntotally  alien \\n\\nDay after day, day after day,\\nWe stuck, nor breath, nor motion;\\nAs idle as a painted ship\\nUpon a painted ocean.\\n\\nI  found  almost  all  my  senior  colleagues  living  with  the\\npain of dashed hopes. There was a widespread feeling that\\nthe  scientists  of  this  laboratory  had  been  cheated  by  the\\nsenior officials in the Ministry of Defence. It was clear to me\\nthat the burial of the Devil was essential for the rise of hope\\nand vision.\\n\\nWhen  about  a  month  later, Admiral  OS  Dawson,  then\\nthe  Chief  of  Naval  Staff,  visited  DRDL,  I  used  it  as  an\\nopportunity  to  make  a  point  with  my  team.  The  Tactical\\nCore Vehicle (TCV) project had been hanging fire for quite\\nsome time. It was conceived as a single core vehicle with\\ncertain  common  subsystems  to  meet  the  requirements  of\\nthe services for a quick reaction Surface-to-Air Missile, an\\nanti-radiation  Air-to-Surface  Missile  which  could  be\\nlaunched \\nI\\nemphasized  the  sea-skimming  role  of  the  core  vehicle  to\\nAdmiral Dawson. I focussed not on its technical intricacies,\\nbut  on  its  battlefield  capabilities;  and  I  highlighted  the\\nproduction plans. The message was loud and clear to my\\nnew  associates—do  not  make  anything  which  you  cannot\\nsell  later  and  do  not  spend  your  life  on  making  one  thing\\nonly. Missile development is a multi-dimensional business\\n—if you remain in any one dimension for a long time, you\\nwill get stuck.\\n\\nfrom  helicopters  or \\n\\nfixed  wing  aircraft. \\n\\nMy initial few months at DRDL were largely interactive. I\\nhad read at St. Joseph’s that an electron may appear as a\\nparticle or wave depending on how you look at it. If you ask\\na particle question, it will give you a particle answer; if you\\nask a wave question, it will give you a wave answer. I not\\nonly  described  and  explained  our  goals,  but  also  made\\nthem  an  interplay  between  our  work  and  ourselves.  I  still\\nrecall quoting Ronald Fischer at one of the meetings, “The\\nsweetness  we  taste  in  a  piece  of  sugar  is  neither  a\\nproperty of the sugar nor a property of ourselves. We are\\nproducing  the  experience  of  sweetness  in  the  process  of\\ninteracting with the sugar.”\\nVery  good  work  on  a  Surface-to-Surface  missile  with  a\\nvertical  riseturn  straight  line  climb-ballistic  path  had  been\\nthe\\ndone  by \\ndetermination of the DRDL workforce, who, in spite of the\\npremature winding up of their earlier projects, were eager\\nto go ahead. I arranged reviews for its various subsystems,\\nto  arrive  at  precise  specifications.  To  the  horror  of  many\\nold-timers in DRDO, I started inviting people from the Indian\\nInstitute of Science, Indian Institutes of Technology, Council\\nfor  Scientific  and  Industrial  Research,  Tata  Institute  of\\nFundamental  Research,  and  many  other  educational\\ninstitutions where related experts could be found. I felt that\\nthe stuffy work centres of DRDL needed a breath of fresh\\n\\nI  was  astonished \\n\\nto  see \\n\\ntime. \\n\\nthat \\n\\n\\x0cair.  Once  we  opened  the  windows  wide,  the  light  of\\nscientific talent began to pour in. Once more, Coleridge’s\\nAncient  Mariner  came  to  mind:  “Swiftly,  swiftly  flew  the\\nship,\\\\ Riding gently the oncoming tide.”\\n\\nSometime  in  the  beginning  of  1983,  Prof.  Dhawan\\nvisited  DRDL.  I  reminded  him  of  his  own  advice  to  me\\nalmost  a  decade  ago:  “You  have  to  dream  before  your\\ndreams  can  come  true.  Some  people  stride  towards\\nwhatever it is that they want in life; others shuffle their feet\\nand never get started because they do not know what they\\nwant—and  do  not  know  how  to  find  it  either.”  ISRO  was\\nlucky to have had Prof. Sarabhai and Prof. Dhawan at the\\nhelm—leaders  who  elucidated  their  goals,  made  their\\nmissions larger than their lives, and could then inspire their\\nentire  workforce.  DRDL  had  not  been  so  lucky.  This\\nexcellent  laboratory  played  a  truncated  role  that  did  not\\nreflect its existing or potential capabilities or even fulfill the\\nexpectations in South Block. I told Prof. Dhawan about the\\nhighly professional, but slightly bewildered team I had. Prof.\\nDhawan  responded  with  his  characteristic  broad  smile\\nwhich could be interpreted in any way one chose.\\n\\nIn  order  to  accelerate  the  pace  of  R&D  activities  at\\nDRDL,  it  was  imperative  that  decisions  on  vital  scientific,\\ntechnical  and  technological  problems  be  taken  quickly.\\nThroughout my career I had zealously pursued openness in\\nscientific matters. I had seen from very close quarters the\\ndecay and disintegration that go with management through\\nclosed-door  consultations  and  secret  manipulations.  I\\nalways  despised  and  resisted  such  efforts.  So  the  first\\nmajor  decision  which  we  took  was  to  create  a  forum  of\\nsenior  scientists  where \\nimportant  matters  could  be\\ndiscussed\\n\\nPlate  9  The  twin-engine \\nindigenous  hovercraft\\nprototype  Nandi  developed  at  ADE,  Bangalore.

Thus,  a  high\\nlevel  body  called  the  Missile  Technology  Committee  was\\nformed  within  DRDL.  The  concept  of  management  by\\nparticipation was evoked and earnest efforts were made to\\nthe\\ninvolve  middle-level  scientists  and  engineers \\nmanagement activities of the laboratory.\\n\\nin \\n\\nDays of debate and weeks of thinking finally culminated\\nin the longterm ‘Guided Missile Development Programme’.\\nI  had  read  somewhere,  “Know  where  you  are  going.  The\\ngreat thing in the world is not knowing so much where we\\nstand, as in what direction we are moving.” What if we did\\nnot have the technological might of the Western countries,\\nwe knew we had to attain that might, and this determination\\nwas our driving force. To draw up a clear and well-defined\\nmissile  development  programme  for  the  production  of\\nindigenous  missiles,  a  committee  was  constituted  under\\nmy chairmanship. The members were ZP Marshall, then the\\nChief of Bharat Dynamics Limited, Hyderabad, NR Iyer, AK\\nKapoor and KS Venkataraman. We drafted a paper for the\\nperusal  of  the  Cabinet  Committee  for  Political  Affairs\\n(CCPA).  The  paper  was  given  its  final  shape  after\\nconsulting \\nthree  Defence\\nServices.  We  estimated  an  expenditure  of  about  Rs  390\\ncrores, spread over a period of twelve years.\\n\\nthe  representatives  of \\n\\nthe \\n\\nDevelopment  programmes  often  get  stuck  by  the  time\\nthey reach the production stage, mainly because of lack of\\nfunding.  We  wanted  to  get  funds  to  develop  and  produce\\ntwo  missiles—a  low-level  quick  reaction  Tactical  Core\\nVehicle and a Medium Range Surface-to-Surface Weapon\\nSystem.  We  planned  to  make  a  surface-to-air  medium\\nrange weapon system with multi-target handling capability\\nduring  the  second  phase.  DRDL  had  been  known  for  its\\npioneering  work  in  the  field  of  anti-tank  missiles.  We\\nproposed  to  develop  a  third  generation  anti-tank  guided\\n‘fire-and-forget’  capabilities.  All  my\\nmissile  having \\ncolleagues  were  pleased  with  the  proposal.  They  saw  an\\nopportunity  to  pursue  afresh  activities  initiated  long  ago.\\nBut I was not entirely satisfied. I longed to revive my buried\\ndream  of  a  Re-entry  Experiment  Launch  Vehicle  (REX).  I\\npersuaded  my  colleagues \\ntechnology\\ndevelopment project to generate data for use in the design\\nof heat shields. These shields were required for building up\\ncapability to make longrange missiles in the future.\\n\\ntake  up  a \\n\\nto \\n\\nI  made  a  presentation  in  the  South  Block.  The\\npresentation was presided over by the Defence Minister of\\nthe  time  R  Venkataraman,  and  attended  by  the  three\\nService  Chiefs:  General  Krishna  Rao,  Air  Chief  Marshal\\nDilbagh  Singh  and  Admiral  Dawson.  The  Cabinet\\nSecretary,  Krishna  Rao  Sahib,  Defence  Secretary,  SM\\nGhosh  and  Secretary,  Expenditure,  R  Ganapathy  were\\npresent.  Everyone  seemed  to  have  all  sorts  of  doubts—\\nabout our capabilities, about the feasibility and availability\\nof  required  technological  infrastructure,  about  the  viability,\\nthe schedule and cost. Dr Arunachalam stood by me like a\\nrock \\nthe  entire  question-answer  session.\\nMembers were skeptical and apprehensive of drift—which\\nthey  felt  was  common  among  scientists.  Although  some\\nquestioned  our  ambitious  proposal,  everyone,  even  the\\ndoubting  Thomases,  were  very  excited  about  the  idea  of\\nIndia having her own missile systems. In the end, we were\\nasked by Defence Minister Venkataraman to meet him in\\nthe evening, about three hours later.\\n\\nthroughout \\n\\nWe spent the intervening time working on permutations\\nand  combinations.  If  they  sanctioned  only  Rs  100  crores,\\nhow would we allocate it? Suppose they gave us Rs 200\\n\\n\\x0chow would we allocate it? Suppose they gave us Rs 200\\ncrores, then what would we do? When we met the Defence\\nMinister in the evening, I had a hunch we were going to get\\nsome  funds  at  any  rate.  But  when  he  suggested  that  we\\nlaunch  an \\nintegrated  guided  missile  development\\nprogramme,  instead  of  making  missiles  in  phases,  we\\ncould not believe our ears.\\n\\nWe were quite dumbfounded by the Defence Minister’s\\nsuggestion. After  a  long  pause,  Dr Arunachalam  replied,\\n“We  beg  for  time  to  rethink  and  return,  Sir!”  “You  come\\nback  tomorrow  morning  please,”  the  Defence  Minister\\nreplied.  It  was  reminiscent  of  Prof.  Sarabhai’s  zeal  and\\nvision. That night, Dr Arunachalam and I laboured together\\non reworking our plan.\\n\\nflights,  evaluation,  updating,  user \\n\\nWe  worked  out  some  very  important  extensions  and\\nimprovements in our proposal, taking all the variables, such\\nas  design,  fabrication,  system  integration,  qualification,\\nexperimental \\ntrials,\\nproducibility,  quality,  reliability,  and  financial  viability  into\\naccount. We then integrated them into a single function of\\ntotal  accountability,  in  order  to  meet  the  needs  of  the\\ncountry’s armed forces with an indigenous endeavour. We\\nworked  out \\nthe  concepts  of  design,  development,\\nproduction  concurrency  and  proposed  the  participation  of\\nuser and inspection agencies right from the drawing-board\\nstage. We also suggested a methodology to achieve state-\\nof-the-art  systems  after  all  the  years  of  developmental\\nactivities.  We  wanted  to  deliver  contemporary  missiles  to\\nour Services and not some outdated inventory of weapons.\\nIt was a very exciting challenge that had been thrown to us.\\n\\nBy  the  time  we  finished  our  work,  it  was  already\\nmorning.  Suddenly,  at  the  breakfast  table,  I  remembered\\nthat  I  was  to  attend  my  niece  Zameela’s  wedding  at\\nRameswaram that evening. I thought it was already too late\\nto do anything. Even if I could catch the Madras flight later in\\nthe day, how would I reach Rameswaram from there? There\\nwas no air link between Madras and Madurai from where I\\ncould board the evening train to Rameswaram. A pang of\\nguilt  dampened  my  spirits.  Was  it  fair,  I  asked  myself,  to\\nforget  my  family  commitments  and  obligations?  Zameela\\nwas more like a daughter to me. The thought of missing her\\nwedding because of professional preoccupations at Delhi\\nwas  very  distressing.  I  finished  breakfast  and  left  for  the\\nmeeting.\\n\\ninto \\n\\nWhen  we  met  Defence  Minister  Venkataraman  and\\nshowed him our revised proposal, he was visibly pleased.\\nThe proposal of the missile development project had been\\nturned  overnight \\nintegrated\\nprogramme with far-reaching consequences. It would have\\nwide-ranging technological spinoffs, and was exactly what\\nthe Defence Minister had had in mind the previous evening.\\nNotwithstanding  the  great  respect  I  had  for  the  Defence\\nMinister,  I  was  not  really  sure  if  he  would  clear  our  entire\\nproposal. But he did. I was absolutely delighted!\\n\\nthe  blueprint  of  an \\n\\nThe  Defence  Minister  stood  up,  signalling  that  the\\nmeeting was over. Turning to me he said, “Since I brought\\nyou here, I was expecting you to come up with something\\nlike this. I am happy to see your work.” In a split second, the\\nmystery  surrounding  the  clearance  of  my  appointment  as\\nDirector  DRDL  in  1982  was  cleared.  So  it  was  Defence\\nMinister Venkataraman who had brought me in! Bowing in\\nthanks,  I  turned  towards  the  door  when  I  heard  Dr\\nArunachalam telling the Minister about Zameela’s wedding\\nbeing  scheduled  for  that  evening  at  Rameswaram.  It\\namazed  me  that  Dr  Arunachalam  should  bring  up  this\\nmatter  before  the  Minister.  Why  would  a  person  of  his\\n\\n\\x0cstature,  sitting \\nthe  all-powerful  South  Block,  be\\nconcerned about a wedding which was to take place on a\\nfar-flung island in a small house on Mosque Street?\\n\\nin \\n\\nI have always had a high regard for Dr Arunachalam. He\\nhas  together  with  a  command  over  language  as  he\\ndisplayed on this occasion, an uncanny presence of mind. I\\nwas  overwhelmed  when  the  Defence  Minister  located  an\\nAir  Force  helicopter  doing  sorties  between  Madras  and\\nMadurai later in the day to take me to Madurai as soon as I\\ndisembarked  at  Madras  from  the  regular  Indian  Airlines\\nflight,  which  was  leaving  Delhi  in  an  hour’s  time.  Dr\\nArunachalam told me, “You have earned this for your hard\\nwork of the last six months.”\\nFlying  towards  Madras,  I  scribbled  on  the  back  of  my\\nboarding pass:\\n\\nWho never climbed the weary league –\\n\\nCan such a foot explore\\nThe purple territories\\nOn Rameswaram’s shore?\\n\\nThe  Air  Force  helicopter  landed  close  to  the  Indian\\nAirlines aircraft as soon as it arrived from Delhi. Within the\\nnext  few  minutes  I  was  on  my  way  to  Madurai.  The  Air\\nForce commandant there was kind enough to take me to\\nthe  railway  station,  where  the  train  to  Rameswaram  was\\njust about to roll out of the platform. I was in Rameswaram\\nwell in time for Zameela’s wedding. I blessed my brother’s\\ndaughter with a father’s love.\\n\\nThe  Defence  Minister  put  up  our  proposal  before  the\\nCabinet and saw it through. His recommendations on our\\nproposal were accepted and an unprecedented amount of\\nRs 388 crores was sanctioned for this purpose. Thus was\\nborn \\nIntegrated  Guided  Missile\\nDevelopment Programme, later abbreviated to IGMDP.\\n\\nIndia’s  prestigious \\n\\nWhen I presented the government sanction letter before\\nthe  Missile  Technology  Committee  at  DRDL,  they  were\\nenthused with fire and action. The proposed projects were\\nchristened  in  accordance  with  the  spirit  of  India’s  self-\\nreliance.  Thus  the  Surface-to-Surface  weapon  system\\nbecame Prithvi (“the Earth”) and the Tactical Core Vehicle\\nwas called Trishul (the trident of Lord Shiva). The Surface-\\nto-Air  area  defence  system  was  named  as Akash  (“sky”)\\nand the anti-tank missile project Nag (“Cobra”). I gave the\\nname Agni (“Fire”) to my long cherished dream of REX. Dr\\nArunachalam  came  to  DRDL  and  formally  launched  the\\nIGMDP on 27 July 1983. It was a great event in which every\\nsingle  employee  of  DRDL  participated.  Everybody  who\\nwas somebody in Indian Aerospace Research was invited.\\nA  large  number  of  scientists  from  other  laboratories  and\\norganizations,  professors \\ninstitutions,\\nrepresentatives  of  the  armed  forces,  production  centres,\\nand inspection authorities, who were our business partners\\nnow,  were  present  on  this  occasion.  A  closed-circuit  TV\\nnetwork had to be pressed into operation to ensure proper\\ncommunication  between  the  participants  for  we  had  no\\nsingle place to accommodate all the invitees. This was the\\nsecond most significant day in my career, next only to 18\\nJuly  1980,  when  the  SLV-3  had  launched  Rohini  into  the\\nearth’s orbit.\\n* * *\\n\\nfrom  academic \\n\\n\\x0c11\\n\\n\\x0cStewards\\n\\nT\\n\\nhe launch of the IGMDP was like a bright flash on the\\nIndian  scientific  firmament.  Missile  Technology  had  been\\nconsidered  the  domain  of  a  few  selected  nations  in  the\\nworld. People\\n\\nwere  curious  to  see  how,  with  what  India  had  at  that\\npoint  of  time,  we  were  going  to  achieve  all  that  was\\npromised.  The  magnitude  of  the  IGMDP  was  really\\nunprecedented in the country and the schedules projected\\nwere quite quixotic by the norms and standards prevailing\\nin  the  Indian  R&D  establishments.  I  was  fully  aware  that\\nobtaining  sanction  for  the  programme  could  at  best  be\\nseen as only ten per cent of the work done. To get it going\\nwould be quite a different matter altogether. The more you\\nhave, the more there is to maintain. Now that we had been\\ngiven all the necessary money and freedom to proceed, I\\nhad to take my team forward and fulfill the promises I had\\nmade.\\n\\nto  realise \\n\\nWhat  would  be  needed \\n\\nthis  missile\\nprogramme,  from  the  design  to  the  deployment  stages?\\nExcellent  manpower  was  available;  money  had  been\\nsanctioned;  and  some  infrastructure  also  existed.  What\\nwas  lacking  then?  What  else  does  a  project  need  to\\nsucceed apart from these three vital inputs? From my SLV-\\n3  experience,  I  thought  I  knew  the  answer.  The  crux  was\\ngoing to be out mastery over missile technology. I expected\\nnothing from abroad. Technology is a group activity and we\\nwould need leaders who could not only put their heart and\\nsoul into the missile programme, but also carry along with\\nthem hundreds of other engineers and scientists. We knew\\nto  encounter  numerous\\nwe  had \\ncontradictions  and  procedural  absurdities \\nthat  were\\nprevalent in the participating laboratories. We would have\\nto  counteract  the  existing  attitudes  of  our  public  sector\\nunits, which believed that their performance would never be\\ntested.  The  whole  system—its  people,  procedures,\\ninfrastructure—would  have  to  learn  to  extend  itself.  We\\ndecided  to  achieve  something  that  was  way  beyond  our\\ncollective national capability and I, for one, had no illusions\\nabout the fact that unless our teams worked on the basis of\\nproportion or probability, nothing would be achieved.\\n\\nto  be  prepared \\n\\nThe  most  remarkable  thing  about  DRDL  was  its  large\\npool  of  highly  talented  people,  many  of  whom  were,\\nunfortunately, \\nrebelliousness.\\nfull  of  egotism  and \\nUnfortunately,  they  had  not  even  accumulated  enough\\nexperience  to  make  them  confident  about  their  own\\njudgement. On the whole, they would discuss matters very\\nenthusiastically, but would finally accept what a select few\\nsaid.  They  would  unquestioningly  believe \\nin  outside\\nspecialists.\\n\\nA particularly interesting person I met in DRDL was AV\\nRanga Rao. He was very articulate and had an impressive\\npersonality. His usual garb consisted of a red neck-tie with\\na checked coat and loose trousers. He would wear this in\\nthe  hot  climate  of  Hyderabad,  where  even  a  longsleeved\\nshirt  and \\nconsidered  an  avoidable\\ninconvenience.  With  his  thick  white  beard  and  a  pipe\\nclamped  between  his  teeth,  there  was  a  certain  aura\\naround \\nrather  egocentric\\nindividual.\\n\\nthis  extremely  gifted,  but \\n\\nshoes  are \\n\\nI  consulted  Ranga  Rao  on  revamping  the  existing\\nmanagement  system  to  achieve  an  optimum  utilization  of\\nhuman  resources.  Ranga  Rao  had  a  series  of  meetings\\n\\n\\x0cwith  the  scientists  sharing  our  vision  of  developing\\nindigenous missile technology and explaining the different\\naspects  of  the  IGMDP.  After  prolonged  discussions,  we\\ndecided  to  reorganize  the  laboratory  into  a  technology-\\noriented  structure.  We  needed  to  accommodate  a  matrix\\ntype  of  structure  for  the  execution  of  various  activities\\nneeded  for  the  projects.  In  less  than  four  months,  four\\nhundred  scientists  began \\nthe  missile\\nprogramme.\\n\\nto  work  on \\n\\nDuring this period, the most important task before me\\nwas the selection of the Project Directors to lead individual\\nmissile projects. We had a very large pool of talent. In fact,\\nit was a market of plenty. The question was whom to pick—\\na  go-getter,  a  planner,  a  maverick,  a  dictator  or  a  team\\nman? I had to get the right type of leader who could clearly\\nvisualize the goal, and channelise the energies of his team\\nmembers who would be working at different work centres in\\npursuit of their own individual goals.\\n\\nIt was a difficult game, some rules of which I had learnt\\nwhile  working  on  ISRO’s  high  priority  projects  for  two\\ndecades.  The  wrong  choice  would  jeopardise  the  entire\\nfuture of the programme. I had a detailed discussion with a\\nlarge  number  of  prospective  scientists  and  engineers.  I\\nwanted these five Project Directors to train another twenty-\\nfive project directors and team leaders of tomorrow.\\n\\nMany of my senior colleagues—naming them would be\\nunfair,  because  it  could  be  only  my  imagination—tried  to\\nbefriend me during this period. I respected their concern for\\na  lonely  man,  but  avoided  any  close  contacts.  Through\\nloyalty  to  a  friend  one  can  be  easily  led  into  doing\\nsomething \\nthe\\norganization.\\n\\ninterests  of \\n\\nthe  best \\n\\nis  not \\n\\nthat \\n\\nin \\n\\nPerhaps  the  main  motive  behind  my  isolation  was  my\\ndesire to escape from the demands of relationships, which\\nI consider very difficult in comparison to making rockets. All\\nI  desired  was  to  be  true  to  my  way  of  life,  to  uphold  the\\nscience of rocketry in my country and to retire with a clean\\nconscience.  I  took  quite  some  time  and  did  a  lot  of  hard\\nthinking  to  decide  who  should  lead  the  five  projects.  I\\nexamined  the  working  styles  of  many  scientists  before\\nmaking my decision. I think some of my observations may\\ninterest you.\\n\\nA  basic  aspect  of  a  person’s  working  style  is  how  he\\nplans and organizes tasks. At one extreme is the cautious\\nplanner, who carefully spells out each step before making\\nany  move.  With  a  sharp  eye  for  what  can  possibly  go\\nwrong, he tries to cover all contingencies. At the other end\\nis the fast mover, who weaves and dodges without a plan.\\nInspired  by  an  idea,  the  fast  mover  is  always  ready  for\\naction.\\n\\nAnother aspect of a person’s working style is control—\\nthe  energy  and  attention  devoted  to  ensuring  that  things\\nhappen  in  a  certain  way.  At  one  extreme  is  the  tight\\ncontroller,  a  strict  administrator  with  frequent  checkpoints.\\nRules and policies are to be followed with religious fervour.\\nAt the opposite end are those who move with freedom and\\nflexibility.  They  have  little  patience  for  bureaucracy.  They\\ndelegate  easily  and  give  their  subordinates  wide  latitude\\nfor movement. I wanted leaders who tread the middle path,\\nthose  who  could  control  without  stifling  dissent  or  being\\nrigid.\\n\\nI  wanted  men  who  had  the  capability  to  grow  with\\npossibilities,  with  the  patience  to  explore  all  possible\\nalternatives, with the wisdom to apply old principles to new\\nsituations;  people  with  the  skill  to  negotiate  their  way\\nforward. I wanted them to be accommodating, to be willing\\n\\n\\x0cto  share  their  power  with  others  and  work  in  teams,\\ndelegating  good \\nfresh  opinions,\\njobs,  assimilating \\nrespecting intelligent people, and listening to wise counsel.\\nThey would have to be able to sort out things amicably, and\\ntake  responsibility  for  slip-ups. Above  all,  they  should  be\\nable to take failure in their stride and share in both success\\nand failure.\\n\\nMy search for someone to lead the Prithvi project ended\\nwith Col VJ Sundaram who belonged to the EME Corps of\\nthe \\nin\\nIndian  Army.  With  a  post-graduate  degree \\nAeronautical  Engineering  and  expertise  in  mechanical\\nvibrations, Sundaram was head of the Structures Group at\\nDRDL. I found in him a readiness to experiment with new\\nways  of  resolving  conflicting  points  of  view.  He  was  an\\nexperimenter  and  innovator  in  team  work.  He  had  an\\nextraordinary  capability  for  evaluating  alternative  ways  of\\noperating.  He  would  suggest  moving  forward  into  new\\nterrains  that  could  lead  to  a  solution  which  had  not  been\\nperceived earlier. Though a particular goal might be clear\\nto  a  project  leader,  and  he  may  be  capable  of  giving\\nadequate  directions  for  accomplishing  it,  there  can  be\\nresistance from subordinates if the goal makes no sense to\\nthem. Therein lies the importance of a leader who provides\\neffective  work  directions.  I  thought  the  Project  Director  of\\nPrithvi would be the first to make decisions with production\\nagencies and the armed forces, and Sundaram would be\\nthe ideal choice to see that sound decisions were taken.\\n\\nFor Trishul, I was looking for a man who not only had a\\nsound  knowledge  of  electronics  and  missile  warfare,  but\\nwho could also communicate the complexities to his team\\nin order to promote understanding and to earn his team’s\\nsupport.  I  found  in  Cmde  SR  Mohan,  who  sailed  into\\nDefence R&D from the Indian Navy, a talent for detail and\\nan almost magical power of persuasion.\\n\\nFor Agni,  my  dream  project,  I  needed  somebody  who\\nwould tolerate my occasional meddling in the running of this\\nproject. In RN Agarwal I found the right person. He was an\\nalumnus  of  MIT  with  a  brilliant  academic  record  and  had\\nbeen  managing  the Aeronautical  Test  Facilities  at  DRDL\\nwith keen professional acumen.\\n\\nDue  to  technological  complexities,  Akash  and  Nag\\nwere then considered missiles of the future; their activities\\nwere  expected  to  peak  about  half  a  decade  later.\\nTherefore, I selected the relatively young Prahlada and NR\\nIyer  for  Akash  and  Nag.  Two  other  young  men,  VK\\nSaraswat  and  AK  Kapoor  were  made  deputies \\nto\\nSundaram and Mohan respectively.\\n\\nIn  those  days,  there  was  no  forum  in  DRDL  where\\nissues  of  general  importance  could  be  openly  discussed\\nand decisions debated. Scientists, it must be remembered,\\nare  basically  emotional  people.  Once  they  stumble,  it  is\\ndifficult for them to pull themselves together. Setbacks and\\ndisappointments have always been and always will be an\\ninherent part of any career, even one in science. However, I\\ndid not want any of my scientists to face disappointments\\nalone. I also wanted to ensure that none of them set their\\ngoals  when  they  were  at  a  low  ebb.  To  avoid  such\\neventualities  a  Science  Council  was  created—a  sort  of\\npanchayat  where  the  community  would  sit  together  and\\ntake common decisions. Every three months, all scientists\\n—juniors  and  seniors,  veterans  and  freshers—  would  sit\\ntogether and let off steam.\\n\\nThe very first meeting of the Council was eventful. After\\na spell of half-hearted enquiries and expressions of doubt,\\none senior scientist, MN Rao, shot a straight question: “On\\n\\n\\x0cwhat basis did you select these five Pandavas (he meant\\nthe  Project  Directors)?”  I  was,  in  fact,  expecting  this\\nquestion.  I  wanted  to  tell  him  that  I  found  all  these  five\\nPandavas  married  to  the  Draupadi  of  positive  thinking.\\nInstead, I told Rao to wait and see. I had chosen them to\\ntake charge of a long-term programme where new storms\\nwould arise everyday.\\n\\nEvery  tomorrow,  I  told  Rao,  will  give  opportunities  to\\nthese enthusiastic people—the Agarwals, Prahladas, Iyers,\\nand  Saras-wats—  to  gain  a  fresh  perspective  on  their\\ngoals and a strong hold on their commitments.\\n\\nintroduce  new  blood \\n\\nWhat  makes  a  productive  leader?  In  my  opinion,  a\\nproductive  leader  must  be  very  competent  in  staffing.  He\\nshould  continually \\nthe\\norganization.  He  must  be  adept  at  dealing  with  problems\\nand new concepts. The problems encountered by an R&D\\norganization  typically  involve  trade-offs  among  a  wide\\nvariety of known and unknown parameters. Skill in handling\\nthese  complex  entities  is  important  in  achieving  high\\nproductivity.  The  leader  must  be  capable  of  instilling\\nenthusiasm in his team. He should give appropriate credit\\nwhere it is due; praise publicly, but criticize privately.\\n\\ninto \\n\\nOne of the most difficult questions came from a young\\nscientist:  “How  are  you  going  to  stop  these  projects  from\\ngoing  the  Devil  way?”  I  explained  to  him  the  philosophy\\nbehind  IGMDP—it  begins  with  design  and  ends  in\\ndeployment. The participation of the production centres and\\nuser  agencies  right  from  the  design  stage  had  been\\nensured  and  there  was  no  question  of  going  back  till  the\\nmissile  systems  had  been  successfully  deployed  in  the\\nbattlefield.\\n\\nWhile  the  process  of  forming  teams  and  organizing\\nwork  was  going  on,  I  found  that  the  space  available  at\\nDRDL  was  grossly  inadequate  to  meet  the  enhanced\\nrequirements of IGMDP. Some of the facilities would have\\nto be located at a nearby site. The missile integration and\\ncheckout facility built during the Devil phase consisted only\\nof  a  120  sq.  metre  shed  thickly  populated  with  pigeons.\\nWhere was the space and the facility to integrate the five\\nmissiles  which  would  arrive  here \\nshortly?  The\\nEnvironmental  Test  Facility  and  the  Avionics  Laboratory\\nwere equally cramped and ill-equipped. I visited the nearby\\nImarat  Kancha  area.  It  used  to  be  the  test  range  for  anti-\\ntank  missiles  developed  by  DRDL  decades  ago.  The\\nterrain  was  barren—there  were  hardly  any  trees—  and\\ndotted with large boulders typical of the Deccan plateau. I\\nfelt  as  if  there  was  some  tremendous  energy  trapped  in\\nthese stones. I decided to locate the integration and check-\\nout facilities needed for the missile projects here. For the\\nnext three years, this became my mission.\\n\\nWe  drew  up  a  proposal  to  establish  a  model  high\\ntechnology  research  centre  with  very  advanced  technical\\nfacilities like an inertial instrumentation laboratory, full-scale\\nenvironmental  and  electronic  warfare  (EMI/EMC)  test\\nfacilities,  a  composites  production  centre,  high  enthalpy\\nfacility,  and  a  state-of-the-art  missile  integration  and\\ncheckout  centre.  By  any  standards,  this  was  a  gigantic\\ntask.  An  altogether  different  brand  of  expertise,  grit  and\\ndetermination  were  required  to  realise  this  project.  Goals\\nand objectives had already been decided upon. Now they\\nhad  to  be  shared  with  a  large  number  of  people  from\\nvarious  agencies, \\nthe  problem-solving  and\\ncommunication processes that the leader of the team must\\nbuild and maintain. Who would be the most suitable person\\nto do so? I saw almost all the required leadership qualities\\nin  MV  Suryakantha  Rao.  Then,  as  a  large  number  of\\n\\nthrough \\n\\n\\x0cthan \\n\\nrather \\n\\nAccording \\n\\nagencies  would  participate  in  the  creation  of  Research\\nCentre  Imarat  (RCI),  someone  had  to  protect  hierarchical\\nsensitivities.  I  selected  Krishna  Mohan,  who  was  in  his\\nmidthirties,  to  complement  Suryakantha  Rao,  who  was  in\\nhis late fifties at that time. Krishna Mohan would encourage\\nrelying  on  obedience  and\\ninvolvement \\nmonitoring people at their workplaces.\\nto \\n\\nthe  established  procedure,  we\\napproached  the  Military  Engineering  Services  (MES)  for\\nthe  RCI  construction  work.  They  said  it  would  take  five\\nyears  to  complete  the  task.  The  matter  was  discussed  in\\ndepth at the highest level in the Ministry of Defence and a\\nlandmark  decision  to  entrust  the  responsibility  of  building\\ndefence structures to an outside construction company was\\ntaken. We liaised with the Survey of India and the National\\nRemote Sensing Agency for the inspection of the contour\\nmaps  and  for  obtaining  aerial  photographs  of  the  Imarat\\nKancha to prepare a layout for the approach roads and the\\nlocation of the facilities. The Central Ground Water Board\\nidentified  twenty  locations  amid  the  rocks  to  tap  water.\\nInfrastructure to provide 40 MVA power and 5 million litres\\nof water per day was planned.\\n\\nIt  was  also  at  this  time  that  Col  SK  Salwan,  a\\nmechanical  engineer  with  boundless  energy,  joined  us.  In\\nthe  final  phase  of  construction,  Salwan  discovered  an\\nancient place of worship among the boulders. It seemed to\\nme that this place was blessed.\\n\\nNow that we had started working on the design of the\\nmissile systems and development had already commenced\\nfor their integration and checkout, the next logical step was\\nto  look  for  a  suitable  site  for  the  missile  flight  trials.  With\\nSHAR  also  in Andhra  Pradesh,  the  search  for  a  suitable\\nsite spread towards the eastern coastline and finally ended\\nat Balasore in Orissa. A site along the north-eastern coast\\nwas identified for a National Test Range. Unfortunately the\\nentire  project  ran  into  rough  weather  because  of  the\\npolitical  issues  raised  around  the  evacuation  of  people\\nliving  in  that  area.  We  decided  therefore  to  create  an\\ninterim  infrastructure  adjacent  to  the  Proof  Experimental\\nEstablishment  (PXE)  at  Chandipur  in  Balasore  district  of\\nOrissa.  A  funding  of  Rs  30  crores  had  been  given  to\\nconstruct the range, called the Interim Test Range (ITR). Dr\\nHS Rama Rao and his team did an excellent job of working\\nout innovative and cost-effective specifications for electro-\\noptical  tracking  instruments,  a  tracking  telescope  system\\nand an instrumentation tracking radar. Lt Gen RS Deswal\\nand Maj Gen KN Singh took charge of creating the launch\\npad  and  range  infrastructure.  There  was  a  beautiful  bird\\nsanctuary in Chandipur. I asked the engineers to design the\\ntest range without disturbing it.\\n\\nCreating  the  RCI  was  perhaps  the  most  satisfying\\nexperience of my life. Developing this centre of excellence\\nof missile technology was akin to the joy of a potter shaping\\nartifacts of lasting beauty from the mundane clay.\\n\\nDefence  Minister  R  Venkataraman  visited  DRDL  in\\nSeptember  1983  to  appraise  himself  of  the  activities  of\\nIGMDP. He advised us to list all the resources we needed\\nto achieve our goals, overlooking nothing, and then include\\nin the list our own positive imagination and faith. “What you\\nimagine, is what will transpire. What you believe is what you\\nwill  achieve,”  he  said.  Both  Dr Arunachalam  and  I  saw  in\\nthe  horizon  endless  possibilities  stretching  out  before\\nIGMDP;  and  our  enthusiasm  proved  infectious.  We  were\\nexcited  and  encouraged  to  see  the  best  professionals  in\\nthe  country  gravitating  towards  IGMDP.  Who  would  not\\n\\n\\x0cwant  to  associate  with  a  winner?  The  word  had  evidently\\ngot around that the IGMDP was a born winner.\\n* * *\\n\\n\\x0c12\\n\\n\\x0cWorkers\\n\\nWe were at a meeting laying down the targets for 1984,\\nwhen  news  came  of  Dr  Brahm  Prakash’s  death  on  the\\nevening of 3 January at Bombay. It was a great emotional\\nloss for me, for I had had the privilege of working under him\\nduring  the  most  challenging  period  of  my  career.  His\\ncompassion  and  humility  were  exemplary.  His  healing\\ntouch on the day of the failed SLV-E1 flight surfaced in my\\nmemory serving to deepen my sorrow.\\n\\nIf  Prof.  Sarabhai  was  the  creator  of  VSSC,  Dr  Brahm\\nPrakash  was  the  executor.  He  had  nurtured  the  institution\\nwhen  it  most  needed  nourishment.  Dr  Brahm  Prakash\\nplayed a very important role in shaping my leadership skills.\\nIn  fact  my  association  with  him  was  a  turning  point  in  my\\nlife. His humility mellowed me and helped me discard my\\naggressive approach. His humility did not consist merely in\\nbeing modest about his talents or virtues, but in respecting\\nthe  dignity  of  all  those  who  worked  under  him  and  in\\nrecognizing  the  fact  that  no  one  is  infallible,  not  even  the\\nleader. He was an intellectual giant with a frail constitution;\\nhe had a childlike innocence and I always considered him a\\nsaint among scientists.\\n\\nDuring this period of renaissance at DRDL, an altitude\\ncontrol system and an on-board computer developed by P\\nBanerjee,  KV  Ramana  Sai  and  their  team  was  almost\\nready.  The  success  of  this  effort  was  very  vital  for  any\\nindigenous missile development programme. All the same,\\nwe had to have a missile to test this important system.\\n\\nAfter  many  brainstorming  sessions,  we  decided  to\\nimprovise a Devil missile to test the system. A Devil missile\\nwas  dis-assembled,  many  modifications  made,  extensive\\nsubsystem  testing  was  done  and  the  missile  checkout\\nsystem  was  reconfigured.  After  installing  a  make-shift\\nlauncher,  the  modified  and  extended  range  Devil  missile\\nwas fired on 26 June 1984 to flight test the first indigenous\\nStrap-down  Inertial  Guidance  system.  The  system  met  all\\nthe  requirements.  This  was  the  first  and  very  significant\\nstep in the history of Indian missile development, which had\\nso  far  been  restricted  to  reverse  engineering,  towards\\ndesigning our own systems. A long-denied opportunity was\\nat last utilized by missile scientists at DRDL. The message\\nwas loud and clear. We could do it!\\n\\nIt  did  not  take  long  for  the  message  to  reach  Delhi.\\nPrime  Minister  Indira  Gandhi  expressed  her  desire  to\\npersonally  apprise  herself  of  the  progress  of  the  IGMDP.\\nThe  entire  organization  was \\nfilled  with  an  aura  of\\nexcitement.  On  19  July  1984,  Shrimati  Gandhi  visited\\nDRDL.\\n\\nPrime  Minister  Indira  Gandhi  was  a  person  with  a\\ntremendous sense of pride—in herself, in her work and in\\nher country. I deemed it an honour to receive her at DRDL\\nas  she  had  instilled  some  of  her  own  pride  into  my\\notherwise  modest  frame  of  mind.  She  was  immensely\\nconscious that she was the leader of eight hundred million\\npeople. Every step, every gesture, every movement of her\\nhands  was  optimised.  The  esteem  in  which  she  held  our\\nwork  in  the  field  of  guided  missiles  boosted  our  morale\\nimmensely.\\n\\nDuring  the  one  hour  that  she  spent  at  DRDL,  she\\ncovered  wideranging  aspects  of  the  IGMDP,  from  flight\\nsystem  plans  to  multiple  development  laboratories.  In  the\\nend,  she  addressed  the  2000-strong  DRDL  community.\\nShe  asked  for  the  schedules  of  the  flight  system  that  we\\nwere working on. “When are you going to flight test Prithvi?”\\n\\n\\x0cShrimati  Gandhi  asked. \\nI  said,  “June  1987.”  She\\nimmediately  responded,  “Let  me  know  what  is  needed  to\\naccelerate  the  flight  schedule.”  She  wanted  scientific  and\\ntechnological  results  fast.  “Your  fast  pace  of  work  is  the\\nhope of the entire nation,” she said. She also told me that\\nthe emphasis of the IGMDP should be not only on schedule\\nbut  also  on  the  pursuance  of  excellence.  “No  matter  what\\nyou achieve, you should never be completely satisfied and\\nshould always be searching for ways to prove yourself,” she\\nadded. Within a month, she demonstrated her interest and\\nsupport by sending the newly appointed Defence Minister,\\nSB  Chavan,  to  review  our  projects.  Shrimati  Gandhi’s\\nfollow-up  approach  was  not  only  impressive,  it  was\\neffective too. Today, everyone associated with aerospace\\nresearch \\nis\\nsynonymous with the IGMDP.\\n\\nin  our  country  knows \\n\\nthat  excellence \\n\\ntesting \\n\\nit  with \\n\\nWe  had  our  home-grown,  but  effective,  management\\ntechniques. One such technique was concerned with follow-\\nup  of  project  activities.  It  basically  consisted  of  analysing\\nthe  technical  as  well  as  procedural  applicability  of  a\\npossible  solution, \\nthe  work  centres,\\ndiscussing  it  with  the  general  body  of  associates  and\\nimplementing it after enlisting everybody’s support. A large\\nnumber of original ideas sprung up from the grass root level\\nof  participating  work  centres.  If  you  were  to  ask  me  to\\nindicate the single most important managerial tactic in this\\nsuccessful  programme,  I  would  point  to  the  pro-active\\nfollow-up.  Through  follow-up  on  the  work  done  at  different\\nlaboratories on design, planning, supporting services, and\\nby the inspection agencies and academic institutions, rapid\\nprogress  has  been  achieved  in  the  most  harmonious\\nmanner.  In  fact,  the  work  code  in  the  Guided  Missile\\nProgramme  Office  was:  if  you  need  to  write  a  letter  to  a\\nwork centre, send a fax; if you need to send a telex or fax,\\ntelephone;  and \\ntelephonic\\nif \\ndiscussions, visit the place personally.\\n\\nthe  need  arises \\n\\nfor \\n\\nThe  power  of  this  approach  came  to  light  when  Dr\\nArunachalam conducted a comprehensive status review of\\nIGMDP  on  27  September  1984.  Experts  from  DRDO\\nLaboratories, ISRO, academic institutions, and production\\nagencies  gathered  to  critically  review  the  progress  made\\nand  problems  faced  in  the  first  year  of  implementation.\\nMajor  decisions  like  the  creation  of  facilities  at  Imarat\\nKancha  and  the  establishment  of  a  test  facility  were\\ncrystallized during the review. The future infrastructure at the\\nImarat  Kancha  was  given  the  name  of  Research  Centre\\nImarat (RCI), retaining the original identity of the place.\\n\\nIt  was  a  pleasure  to  find  an  old  acquaintance,  TN\\nSeshan, on the review board. Between SLV-3 and now, we\\nhad  developed  a  mutual  affection.  However,  this  time  as\\nthe  Defence  Secretary,  Seshan’s  queries  about \\nthe\\nschedules and viability of financial propositions presented\\nwere much more pointed. Seshan is a person who enjoys\\nverbally  bringing  adversaries  to  their  knees.  Using  his\\nsharp-edged  humour,  Seshan  would  make  his  opponents\\nlook ridiculous. Although he is prone to be loud and can turn\\nargumentative  on  occasions,  in  the  end  he  would  always\\nensure  maximization  of  all  available  resources  towards  a\\nsolution that was within implementation. At a personal level,\\nSeshan is a very kind-hearted and considerate person. My\\nteam  was  particularly  pleased  to  answer  his  questions\\nabout the advanced technology employed in the IGMDP. I\\nstill  remember  his  uncanny  curiosity  about  the  indigenous\\ndevelopment of carbon-carbon composites. And to let you\\ninto a small secret—Seshan is perhaps the only person in\\nthe  world  who  enjoys  calling  me  by  my  full  name  which\\n\\n\\x0ccontains  31 \\nJainulabdeen Abdul Kalam.\\n\\nletters  and \\n\\nfive  words—Avul  Pakir\\n\\nThe missile programme had been pursued concurrently\\nand  had  partners  in  design,  development  and  production\\nfrom  12  academic  institutions  and  30  laboratories  from\\nDRDO,  the  Council  of  Scientific  and  Industrial  Research\\n(CSIR), ISRO and industry. In fact, more than 50 professors\\nand  100  research  scholars  worked  on  missile-related\\nproblems  in  the  laboratories  of  their  respective  institutes.\\nThe quality of work achieved through this partnership in that\\none  year  had  given  me  tremendous  confidence  that  any\\ndevelopment task could be undertaken within the country so\\nlong  as  we  have  our  focussed  schedules.  Four  months\\nbefore this review, I think it was during April–June 1984, six\\nof  us \\nthe  missile  programme  visited  academic\\ncampuses  and  enlisted  promising  young  graduates.  We\\npresented an outline of the missile programme before the\\nprofessors  and  the  aspiring  students,  about  350  of  them,\\nand requested them to participate. I informed the reviewers\\nthat we were expecting around 300 young engineers to join\\nour laboratories.\\n\\nin \\n\\nRoddam  Narasimha,  then  Director  of  the  National\\nAeronautical Laboratory, used the occasion of this review\\nto  put  up  a  strong  case  for  technology  initiative.  He  cited\\nthe  experiences  of  the  green  revolution,  which  had\\ndemonstrated  beyond  doubt  that  if  the  goals  were  clear,\\nthere  was  enough  talent  available  in  the  country  to  tackle\\nmajor technological challenges.\\n\\nWhen  India  carried  out  its  first  nuclear  explosion  for\\npeaceful purposes, we declared ourselves the sixth country\\nin  the  world  to  explode  a  nuclear  device.  When  we\\nlaunched  SLV-3  we  were  the  fifth  country  to  achieve\\nsatellite launch capability. When were we going to be the\\nfirst  or  second  country \\nto  achieve  a\\nin \\ntechnological feat?\\n\\nthe  world \\n\\nI listened carefully to the review members as they aired\\ntheir opinions and doubts, and I learned from their collective\\nwisdom. It was indeed a great education for me. Ironically,\\nall through school, we were taught to read, write and speak,\\nbut  never  to  listen,  and  the  situation  remains  much  the\\nsame today. Traditionally, Indian scientists have been very\\ngood speakers, but have inadequately developed listening\\nskills. We made a resolution to be attentive listeners. Are\\nengineering  structures  not  built  on  the  foundation  of\\nfunctional  utility?  Does  technical  know-how  not  form  its\\nbricks?  And,  are  these  bricks  not  put  together  with  the\\nmortar of constructive criticism? The foundation had been\\nlaid, the bricks baked, and now the mortar to cement our\\nact together was being mixed.\\n\\nWe were working on the action plan that had emerged\\nfrom the earlier month’s review, when the news of Shrimati\\nGandhi’s  assassination  broke.  This  was  followed  by  the\\nnews of widespread violence and riots. A curfew had been\\nimposed in Hyderabad city. We rolled up the PERT charts\\nand a city map was spread out over the table to organize\\ntransport and safe passage for all employees. In less than\\nan  hour,  the  laboratory  wore  a  deserted  look.  I  was  left\\nsitting  alone  in  my  office.  The  circumstances  of  Shrimati\\nGandhi’s  death  were  very  ominous.  The  memories  of  her\\nvisit  barely  three  months  ago  further  deepened  my  pain.\\nWhy  should  great  people  meet  with  such  horrific  ends?  I\\nrecollected my father telling someone in a similar context:\\n“Good and bad people live together under the sun as the\\nblack  thread  and  the  white  are  woven  together  in  a  cloth.\\nWhen  either  one  of  the  black  or  white  thread  breaks,  the\\n\\n\\x0cweaver shall look into the whole cloth, and he shall examine\\nthe loom also.” When I drove out of the laboratory there was\\nnot a single soul on the road. I kept thinking about the loom\\nof the broken thread.\\n\\nShrimati Gandhi’s death was a tremendous loss to the\\nscientific  community.  She  had  given  impetus  to  scientific\\nresearch in the country. But India is a very resilient nation. It\\ngradually  absorbed \\nthe  shock  of  Shrimati  Gandhi’s\\nassassination,  although  at  the  cost  of  thousands  of  lives\\nand a colossal loss of property. Her son, Rajiv Gandhi, took\\nover  as  the  new  Prime  Minister  of  India.  He  went  to  the\\npolls  and  obtained  a  mandate  from  the  people  to  carry\\nforward the policies of Mrs. Gandhi, the Integrated Guided\\nMissile Development Programme being a part of them.\\n\\nBy  the  summer  of  1985,  all  the  groundwork  had  been\\ncompleted  for  building  the  Missile  Technology  Research\\nCentre at Imarat Kancha. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi laid\\nthe  foundation  stone  of  the  Research  Centre  Imarat  (RCI)\\non  3  August  1985.  He  appeared  very  pleased  with  the\\nprogress  made.  There  was  a  child-like  curiosity  in  him\\nwhich  was  very  engaging.  The  grit  and  determination\\ndisplayed  by  his  mother  when  she  visited  us  a  year  ago\\nwas also present in him, although with a small difference.\\nMadam Gandhi was a taskmaster, whereas Prime Minister\\nRajiv  Gandhi  used  his  charisma  to  achieve  his  ends.  He\\ntold the DRDL family that he realised the hardships faced\\nby  Indian  scientists  and  expressed  his  gratitude  towards\\nthose  who  preferred  to  stay  back  and  work  in  their\\nmotherland rather than go abroad for comfortable careers.\\nHe said that nobody could concentrate on work of this type\\nunless  he  was  free  from  the  trivialities  of  daily  life,  and\\nassured  us  that  whatever  necessary  would  be  done  to\\nmake scientists’ lives more comfortable.\\n\\nWithin  a  week  of  his  visit,  I  left  for  the  USA  with  Dr\\nArunachalam  on  an  invitation  from  the  United  States  Air\\nForce.  Roddam  Narasimha  of  National  Aeronautical\\nLaboratory  and  KK  Ganapathy  of  HAL  accompanied  us.\\nAfter finishing our work at the Pentagon in Washington, we\\nlanded in San Francisco on our way to Los Angeles to visit\\nNorthrop Corporation. I utilized this opportunity to visit the\\nCrystal  Cathedral  built  by  my  favourite  author,  Robert\\nSchuller. I was amazed by the sheer beauty of this all-glass,\\nfour-pointed,  star-shaped  structure  that  is  more  than  400\\nfeet from one point to another. The glass roof which is 100\\nfeet  longer  than  a  football  field  seemed  to  float  in  space.\\nThis Cathedral has been built at the cost of several million\\ndollars through donations organized by Schuller. “God can\\ndo tremendous things through the person who doesn’t care\\nabout who gets the credit. The ego involvement must go,”\\nwrites  Schuller.  “Before  God  trusts  you  with  success,  you\\nhave  to  prove  yourself  humble  enough  to  handle  the  big\\nprize.” I prayed to God in Schuller’s church to help me build\\na Research Centre at the Imarat Kancha—that would be my\\nCrystal Cathedral.\\n* * *\\n\\n\\x0c13\\n\\n\\x0cTriumphant\\n\\nThe young engineers, 280 to be precise, changed the\\ndynamics of DRDL. It was a valuable experience for all of\\nus.  We  were  now  in  a  position  to  develop,  through  these\\nyoung  teams,  a  re-entry  technology  and  structure,  a\\nmillimetric  wave  radar,  a  phased  array  radar,  rocket\\nsystems and other such equipment. When we first assigned\\nthese tasks to the young scientists, they did not fully grasp\\nthe importance of their work. Once they did, they felt uneasy\\nunder the burden of the tremendous faith placed in them. I\\nstill remember one young man telling me, “There is no big\\nshot in our team, how will we be able to break through?” I\\ntold him, “A big shot is a little shot who keeps on shooting,\\nso keep trying.” It was astonishing to see how in the young\\nscientific  environment,  negative  attitudes  changed \\nto\\npositive and things that were previously thought impractical\\nbegan happening. Many older scientists were rejuvenated\\nsimply by being part of a young team.\\n\\nIt has been my personal experience that the true flavour,\\nthe  real  fun,  the  continuous  excitement  of  work  lie  in  the\\nprocess of doing it rather than in having it over and done\\nwith. To return to the four basic factors that I am convinced\\nare involved in successful outcomes: goal-setting, positive\\nthinking, visualizing, and believing.\\n\\nBy now, we had gone through an elaborate exercise of\\ngoal-setting and enthused the young scientists about these\\ngoals.  At  the  review  meetings,  I  would  insist  that  the\\nyoungest  scientists  present  their  team’s  work.  That  would\\nhelp  them  in  visualizing  the  whole  system.  Gradually,  an\\natmosphere  of  confidence  grew.  Young  scientists  started\\nquestioning  senior  colleagues  on  solid  technical  issues.\\nNothing daunted them, because they feared nothing. If there\\nwere  doubts,  they  rose  above  them.  They  soon  became\\npersons  of  power.  A  person  with  belief  never  grovels\\nbefore  anyone,  whining  and  whimpering  that  it’s  all  too\\nmuch,  that  he  lacks  support,  that  he  is  being  treated\\nunfairly. Instead, such a person tackles problems head on\\nand  then  affirms,  ‘As  a  child  of  God,  I  am  greater  than\\nanything  that  can  happen  to  me’.  I  tried  to  keep  the  work\\nenvironment  lively  with  a  good  blend  of  the  experience  of\\nthe  older  scientists  mixed  with  the  skills  of  their  younger\\ncolleagues.  This  positive  dependence  between  youth  and\\nexperience  had  created  a  very  productive  work  culture  at\\nDRDL.\\nThe \\n\\nthe  Missile  Programme  was\\nconducted  on  16  September  1985,  when  Trishul  took  off\\nfrom the test range at Sriharikota (SHAR). It was a ballistic\\nflight meant for testing the inflight performance of the solid\\npropellant rocket motor. Two C-Band radars and Kalidieo-\\ntheodolite (KTLs) were used to track the missile from the\\nground.  The  test  was  successful.  The  launcher,  rocket\\nmotor  and  telemetry  systems  functioned  as  planned.  The\\naerodynamic drag however was higher than the estimates\\npredicted  on  the  basis  of  wind  tunnel  testing.  In  terms  of\\ntechnology  breakthrough  or  experience  enrichment,  this\\ntest was of little value but the real achievement of this test\\nwas to remind my DRDL friends that they could fly missiles\\nwithout being driven by the brute demands of compliance\\nor reverse engineering. In a swift stroke, the psyche of the\\nDRDL \\nscientists  experienced  a  multi-dimensional\\nexpansion.\\n\\nlaunch  of \\n\\nfirst \\n\\nThis  was  followed  by  the  successful  test  flight  of  the\\nPilotless  Target  Aircraft  (PTA).  Our  engineers  had\\ndeveloped  the  rocket  motor  for  the  PTA  designed  by  the\\n\\n\\x0cAeronautical \\n\\nBangalore-based \\nDevelopment\\nEstablishment (ADE). The motor had been type- approved\\nby  DTD&P  (Air).  This  was  a  small  but  significant  step\\ntowards  developing  missile  hardware  that  is  not  only\\nfunctional  but  also  acceptable  to  the  user  agencies.  A\\nprivate  sector  firm  was  engaged  to  produce  a  reliable,\\nairworthy,  high  thrust-to-weight  ratio  rocket  motor  with\\ntechnology  input  from  DRDL.  We  were  slowly  graduating\\nfrom  single \\nto  multi-laboratory\\nprogrammes \\nlaboratory-industry  exercises.  The\\ndevelopment of PTA symbolized a great confluence of four\\ndifferent  organizations.  I  felt  as  if  I  was  standing  at  a\\nmeeting point and looking at the roads coming from ADE,\\nDTD&P (Air) and ISRO. The fourth road was the DRDL, a\\nhighway to national self-reliance in missile technology.\\n\\nlaboratory  projects \\nto \\n\\nTaking our partnership with the academic institutions of\\nthe  country  a  step  further,  Joint  Advanced  Technology\\nProgrammes were started at the Indian Institute of Science\\n(IISc), and Jadavpur University. I have always had a deep\\nregard for academic institutions and reverence for excellent\\nacademicians.  I  value  the  inputs  that  academicians  can\\nmake  to  development.  Formal  requests  had  been  placed\\nwith  these  institutions  and  arrangements  arrived  at  under\\nwhich  expertise  from  their  faculties  would  be  extended  to\\nDRDL in pursuance of its projects.\\n\\nLet  me  highlight  a  few  contributions  of  academic\\ninstitutions to the various missile systems. Prithvi had been\\ndesigned  as  an  inertially  guided  missile.  To  reach  the\\ntarget  accurately,  the  trajectory  parameters  have  to  be\\nloaded  into  its  brain—an  on-board  computer.  A  team  of\\nyoung engineering graduates at Jadavpur University under\\nthe  guidance  of  Prof.  Ghoshal  developed  the  required\\nrobust  guidance  algorithm.  At  the  IISc,  postgraduate\\nstudents  under \\nIG  Sharma\\ndeveloped air defence software for multi-target acquisition\\nby Akash. The re- entry vehicle system design methodology\\nfor Agni was developed by a young team at IIT Madras and\\nDRDO  scientists.  Osmania  University’s  Navigational\\nElectronics  Research  and  Training  Unit  had  developed\\nstateof-the-art signal processing algorithms for Nag. I have\\nonly  given  a  few  examples  of  collaborative  endeavour.  In\\nfact,  it  would  have  been  very  difficult  to  achieve  our\\nadvanced \\nthe  active\\ntechnological  goals  without \\npartnership of our academic institutions.\\n\\nleadership  of  Prof. \\n\\nthe \\n\\nLet  us  consider  the  example  of  the  Agni  payload\\nbreakthrough.  Agni  is  a  two-stage  rocket  system  and\\nemploys  re-entry  technology  developed  in  the  country  for\\nthe  first  time.  It  is  boosted  by  a  first-stage  solid  rocket\\nmotor  derived  from  SLV-3  and  further  accelerated  at  the\\nsecond stage with the liquid rocket engines of Prithvi. For\\nthe Agni, the payload gets delivered at hypersonic speeds,\\nwhich  calls  for  the  design  and  development  of  a  re-entry\\nvehicle structure. The payload with guidance electronics is\\nhoused in the re-entry vehicle structure, which is meant to\\nprotect  the  payload  by  keeping  the  inside  temperature\\nwithin the limit of 40oC, when the outside skin temperature\\nis  greater  than  2500oC. An  inertial  guidance  system  with\\nan on-board computer guides the payload to the required\\ntarget.  For  any  re-entry  missile  system,  three-dimensional\\npreforms  are  core  material  for  making  the  carbon-carbon\\nnose  tip  that  will  remain  strong  even  at  such  high\\ntemperatures.  Four  laboratories  of  DRDO  and  the  CSIR\\nachieved  this  in  a  short  span  of  18  months—  something\\nother  countries  could  do  only  after  a  decade  of  research\\nand development!\\n\\nAnother challenge involved in the Agni payload design\\n\\n\\x0cwas  related  to  the  tremendous  speed  with  which  it  would\\nre-enter  the  atmosphere.  In  fact,  Agni  would  re-enter  the\\natmosphere at twelve times the speed of sound (12 Mach,\\nas we call it in science). At this tremendous speed, we had\\nno experience of how to keep the vehicle under control. To\\ncarry out a test, we had no wind tunnel to generate that kind\\nof speed. If we sought American help, we would have been\\nseen  as  aspiring  to  something  they  considered  their\\nexclusive  privilege.  Even  if  they  consented  to  co-operate,\\nthey would be certain to quote a price for their wind tunnel\\ngreater  than  our  entire  project  budget.  Now,  the  question\\nwas how to beat the system. Prof. SM Deshpande of the\\nIISc found four young, bright scientists working in the field of\\nfluid  dynamics  and,  within  six  months,  developed  the\\nsoftware for Computational Fluid Dynamics for Hypersonic\\nRegimes, which is one of its kind in the world.\\n\\nAnother achievement was the development of a missile\\ntrajectory  simulation  software, ANUKALPANA  by  Prof.  IG\\nSharma  of \\nto  evaluate  multi-target  acquisition\\ncapabilities of an Akash-type weapon system. No country\\nwould  have  given  us  this  kind  of  software,  but  we\\ndeveloped it indigenously.\\n\\nIISc \\n\\nIn yet another example of creating a synergy of scientific\\ntalent, Prof. Bharati Bhatt of IIT Delhi, working with the Solid\\nPhysics Laboratory (SPL) and Central Electronics Limited\\n(CEL),  broke  the  monopoly  of  the  western  countries  by\\ndeveloping  ferrite  phase  shifters  for  use  in  the  multi-\\nfunction,  multi-tasking  3-D  Phased  Army  Radar \\nfor\\nsurveillence, tracking and guidance of Akash. Prof. Saraf of\\nIIT,  Kharagpur,  working  with  BK  Mukho-padhyay,  my\\ncolleague at RCI, made a millimetric wave (MMW) antenna\\nfor  the  Nag  Seeker  Head  in  two  years,  a  record  even  by\\ninternational  standards.  The  Central  Electrical  and\\nElectronics  Research  Institute  (CEERI),  Pilani  developed\\nan  Impatt  Diode  in  consortium  with  the  SPL  and  RCI  to\\novercome  technological  foreign  dependence  in  creating\\nthese  components,  which  are  the  heart  of  any  MMW\\ndevice.\\n\\nAs work on the project spread horizontally, performance\\nappraisal became more and more difficult. DRDO has an\\nassessment-linked policy. Leading nearly 500 scientists, I\\nhad to finalize their performance appraisals in the form of\\nAnnual Confidential Reports (ACRs). These reports would\\nbe  forwarded  to  an  assessment  board  comprised  of\\noutside  specialists  for  recommendations.  Many  people\\nviewed  this  part  of  my  job  uncharitably.  Missing  a\\npromotion  was  conveniently  translated  as  a  dislike  I  had\\ntowards  them.  Promotions  of  other  colleagues  were  seen\\nas  subjective  favours  granted  by  me.  Entrusted  with  the\\ntask of performance evaluation, I had to be a fair judge.\\n\\nTo  truly  understand  a  judge,  you  must  understand  the\\nriddle of the scales; one side heaped high with hope, the\\nother  side  holding  apprehension.  When  the  scales  dip,\\nbright optimism turns into silent panic.\\n\\nWhen a person looks at himself, he is likely to misjudge\\nwhat  he  finds.  He  sees  only  his  intentions.  Most  people\\nhave  good  intentions  and  hence  conclude  that  whatever\\nthey  are  doing  is  good.  It  is  difficult  for  an  individual  to\\nobjectively judge his actions, which may be, and often are,\\ncontradictory to his good intentions. Most people come to\\nwork  with  the  intention  of  doing  it.  Many  of  them  do  their\\nwork in a manner they find convenient and leave for home\\nin  the  evening  with  a  sense  of  satisfaction.  They  do  not\\nevaluate  their  performance,  only  their  intentions.  It  is\\nassumed  that  because  an  individual  has  worked  with  the\\n\\n\\x0cintention  of  finishing  his  work  in  time,  if  delays  occurred,\\nthey  were  due  to  reasons  beyond  his  control.  He  had  no\\nintention of causing the delay. But if his action or inaction\\ncaused that delay, was it not intentional?\\n\\nLooking  back  on  my  days  as  a  young  scientist,  I  am\\naware that one of the most constant and powerful urges I\\nexperienced was my desire to be more than what I was at\\nthat  moment.  I  desired  to  feel  more,  learn  more,  express\\nmore.  I  desired  to  grow,  improve,  purify,  expand.  I  never\\nused any outside influence to advance my career. All I had\\nwas the inner urge to seek more within myself. The key to\\nmy motivation has always been to look at how far I had still\\nto go rather than how far I had come. After all, what is life\\nbut  a  mixture  of  unsolved  problems,  ambiguous  victories,\\nand amorphous defeats?\\n\\nThe trouble is that we often merely analyse life instead\\nof  dealing  with  it.  People  dissect  their  failures  for  causes\\nand effects, but seldom deal with them and gain experience\\nto master them and thereby avoid their recurrence. This is\\nmy belief: that through difficulties and problems God gives\\nus  the  opportunity  to  grow.  So  when  your  hopes  and\\ndreams  and  goals  are  dashed,  search  among \\nthe\\nwreckage, you may find a golden opportunity hidden in the\\nruins.\\n\\nforce \\n\\nTo motivate people to enhance their performance and\\ndeal with depression is always a challenge for a leader. I\\nhave  observed  an  analogy  between  a \\nfield\\nequilibrium and resistance to change in organizations. Let\\nus  imagine  change  to  be  a  coiled  spring  in  a  field  of\\nopposing  forces,  such  that  some  forces  support  change\\nand  others  resist  it.  By  increasing  the  supportive  forces\\nsuch as supervisory pressure, prospects of career growth\\nand  monetary  benefits  or  decreasing  the  resisting  forces\\nsuch as group norms, social rewards, and work avoidance,\\nthe situation can be directed towards the desired result—\\nbut  for  a  short  time  only,  and  that  too  only  to  a  certain\\nextent.  After  a  while  the  resisting  forces  push  back  with\\ngreater  force  as  they  are  compressed  even  more  tightly.\\nTherefore,  a  better  approach  would  be  to  decrease  the\\nresisting  force  in  such  a  manner  that \\nis  no\\nconcomittant increase in the supporting forces. In this way,\\nless  energy  will  be  needed  to  bring  about  and  maintain\\nchange.\\n\\nthere \\n\\nI \\n\\nfirst  attempted \\n\\nThe result of the forces I mentioned above, is motive. It\\nis a force which is internal to the individual and forms the\\nbasis  of  his  behaviour  in  the  work  environment.  In  my\\nexperience, most people possess a strong inner drive for\\ngrowth, competence, and self- actualization. The problem,\\nhowever,  has  been  the  lack  of  a  work  environment  that\\nstimulates and permits them to give full expression to this\\ndrive.  Leaders  can  create  a  high  productivity  level  by\\nproviding  the  appropriate  organizational  structure  and  job\\ndesign, and by acknowledging and appreciating hard work.\\nto  build  up  such  a  supportive\\nenvironment in 1983, while launching IGMDP. The projects\\nwere in the design phase at that time. The re-organization\\nresulted in at least forty per cent to fifty per cent increase in\\nthe  level  of  activity.  Now  that  the  multiple  projects  were\\nentering  into  the  development  and  flight-testing  stage,  the\\nmajor and minor milestones reached gave the programme\\nvisibility  and  continuous  commitment.  With  the  absorption\\nof a young team of scientists, the average age had been\\nbrought down from 42 to 33 years. I felt it was time for a\\nsecond re-organization. But how should I go about it? I took\\nstock of the motivational inventory available at that time—\\nlet  me  explain  to  you  what  I  mean  by  this  term.  The\\n\\n\\x0cmotivational inventory of a leader is made up of three types\\nof  understanding:  an  understanding  of  the  needs  that\\npeople expect to satisfy in their jobs, an understanding of\\nthe  effect  that  job  design  has  on  motivation,  and  an\\nunderstanding  of  the  power  of  positive  reinforcement  in\\ninfluencing people’s behaviour.\\n\\nThe 1983 re-organization was done with the objective of\\nrenewal:  it  was  indeed  a  very  complex  exercise  handled\\ndeftly  by  AV  Ranga  Rao  and  Col  R  Swaminathan.  We\\ncreated  a  team  of  newly-joined  young  scientists  with  just\\none  experienced  person  and  gave  them  the  challenge  of\\nbuilding  the  strap-down  inertial  guidance  system,  an  on-\\nboard  computer  and  a  ram  rocket  in  propulsion  system.\\nThese exercises were being attempted for the first time in\\nthe  country,  and  the  technology  involved  was  comparable\\nwith  world-class  systems.  The  guidance  technology  is\\ncentred around the gyro and accelerometer package, and\\nelectronics,  to  process  the  sensor  output.  The  on-board\\ncomputer  carries  the  mission  computations  and  flight\\nsequencing. A ram rocket system breathes air to sustain its\\nhigh  velocity  for  long  durations  after  it  is  put  through  a\\nbooster rocket. The young teams not only designed these\\nsystems  but  also  developed \\ninto  operational\\nequipment.  Later  Prithvi  and  then  Agni  used  similar\\nguidance systems, with excellent results. The effort of these\\nyoung  teams  made  the  country  self-reliant  in  the  area  of\\nprotected technologies. It was a good demonstration of the\\n‘renewal  factor’.  Our  intellectual  capacity  was  renewed\\nthrough  contact  with  enthusiastic  young  minds  and  had\\nachieved these outstanding results.\\n\\nthem \\n\\nNow, besides the renewal of manpower, emphasis had\\nto  be  laid  on  augmenting  the  strength  of  project  groups.\\nOften people seek to satisfy their social, egoistic, and self-\\nactualization  needs  at  their  workplaces.  A  good  leader\\nmust  identify  two  different  sets  of  environmental  features.\\nOne, which satisfies a person’s needs and the other, which\\ncreates  dissatisfaction  with  his  work.  We  have  already\\nobserved that people look for those characteristics in their\\nwork that relate to the values and goals which they consider\\nimportant as giving meaning to their lives. If a job meets the\\nemployees’need \\nrecognition,\\nresponsibility, growth and advancement, they will work hard\\nto achieve goals.\\n\\nachievement, \\n\\nfor \\n\\nOnce the work is satisfying, a person then looks at the\\nenvironment  and  circumstances  in  the  workplace.  He\\nobserves the policies of the administration, qualities of his\\nleader,  security,  status  and  working  conditions.  Then,  he\\ncorrelates  these  factors  to  the  inter-personal  relations  he\\nhas  with  his  peers  and  examines  his  personal  life  in  the\\nlight  of  these  factors.  It  is  the  agglomerate  of  all  these\\naspects that decides the degree and quality of a person’s\\neffort and performance.\\n\\nThe  matrix  organization  evolved \\n\\nin  1983  proved\\nexcellent  in  meeting  all  these  requirements.  So,  while\\nretaining  this  structure  of  the  laboratory,  we  undertook  a\\ntask-design exercise. The scientists working in technology\\ndirectorates  were  made  system  managers  to  interact\\nexclusively  with  one  project.  An  external  fabrication  wing\\nwas formed under PK Biswas, a developmental fabrication\\ntechnologist of long standing, to deal with the public sector\\nundertakings  (PSUs)  and  private  sector  firms  associated\\nwith the development of the missile hardware. This reduced\\npressure on the in-house fabrication facilities and enabled\\nthem to concentrate on jobs which could not be undertaken\\noutside, which in fact occupied all the three shifts.\\n\\n\\x0cflexibility \\n\\nWork  on  Prithvi  was  nearing  completion  when  we\\nentered  1988.  For  the  first  time  in  the  country,  clustered\\nLiquid  Propellant  (LP)  rocket  engines  with  programmable\\ntotal impulse were going to be used in a missile system to\\nattain \\nin  payload  range  combination.  Now,\\nbesides  the  scope  and  quality  of  the  policy  decisions\\nSundaram  and  I  were  providing  to  the  Prithvi  team,  the\\nproject’s  success  depended  on  creative  ideas  being\\nconverted  into  workable  products  and  the  quality  and\\nthoroughness of the team members’ contribution. Saraswat\\nwith  Y  Gyaneshwar  and  P  Venugopalan  did  a\\ncommendable job in this regard. They instilled in their team\\na  sense  of  pride  and  achievement.  The  importance  of\\nthese  rocket  engines  was  not  restricted  to  the  Prithvi\\nproject—it  was  a  national  achievement.  Under \\ntheir\\ncollective  leadership,  a  large  number  of  engineers  and\\ntechnicians  understood  and  committed  themselves  to  the\\nteam goals, as well as the specific goals which each one of\\nthem was committed to accomplish personally. Their entire\\nteam worked under a self-evident sort of direction. Working\\ntogether  with  the  Ordnance  Factory,  Kirkee,  they  also\\ncompletely  eliminated  the  import  content  in  the  propellant\\nfor these engines.\\n\\nLeaving  the  vehicle  development  in  the  safe  and\\nefficient  hands  of  Sundaram  and  Saraswat,  I  started\\nlooking  at  the  mission’s  vulnerable  areas.  Meticulous\\nplanning  had  gone  into  the  development  of  the  launch\\nrelease  mechanism  (LRM)  for  the  smooth  lift-off  of  the\\nmissile. The joint development of explosive bolts to hold the\\nLRM prior to the launch by DRDL and Explosive Research\\nand  Development  Laboratory  (ERDL)  was  an  excellent\\nexample of multi- work centre coordination.\\n\\nWhile  flying,  drifting  into  spells  of  contemplation  and\\nlooking down at the landscape below has always been my\\nfavourite  preoccupation.  It  is  so  beautiful,  so  harmonious,\\nso peaceful from a distance that I wonder where all those\\nboundaries  are  which  separate  district  from  district,  state\\nfrom state, and country from country. Maybe such a sense\\nof distance and detachment is required in dealing with all\\nthe activities of our life.\\n\\nSince  the  Interim  Test  Range  at  Balasore  was  still  at\\nleast a year away from completion, we had set up special\\nfacilities at SHAR for the launch of Prithvi. These included a\\nlaunch  pad,  block  house,  control  consoles  and  mobile\\ntelemetry stations. I had a happy reunion with my old friend\\nMR  Kurup  who  was  the  Director,  SHAR  Centre  by  then.\\nWorking  with  Kurup  on  the  Prithvi  launch  campaign  gave\\nme great satisfaction. Kurup worked for Prithvi as a team\\nmember, ignoring the boundary lines that divide DRDO and\\nISRO, DRDL and SHAR. Kurup used to spend a lot of time\\nwith  us  at  the  launch  pad.  He  complemented  us  with  his\\nexperience in range testing and range safety and worked\\nwith  great  enthusiasm  in  propellant  filling,  making  the\\nmaiden Prithvi launch campaign a memorable experience.\\nPrithvi was launched at 11:23 hrs on 25 February 1988.\\nIt was an epoch-making event in the history of rocketry in\\nthe  country.  Prithvi  was  not  merely  a  surface-to-surface\\nmissile  with  a  capability  of  delivering  a  1000  kg\\nconventional  warhead  to  a  distance  of  150  km  with  an\\naccuracy of 50 meter CEP; it was in fact the basic module\\nfor all future guided missiles in the country. It already had\\nthe provision for modification from a long-range surface to\\nan  air  missile  system,  and  could  also  be  deployed  on  a\\nship.\\n\\nThe accuracy of a missile is expressed in terms of its\\nCircular Error Probable (CEP). This measures the radius of\\n\\n\\x0ca  circle  within  which  50  per  cent  of  the  missiles  fired  will\\nimpact.  In  other  words,  if  a  missile  has  a  CEP  of  1  km\\n(such as the Iraqi Scud missiles fired in the Gulf War), this\\nmeans that half of them should impact within 1 km of their\\ntarget.  A  missile  with  a  conventional  high-explosive\\nwarhead  and  a  CEP  of  1  km  would  not  normally  be\\nexpected to destroy or disable fixed military targets such as\\na Command and Control Facility or an Air Base. It would\\nhowever be effective against an undefined target such as a\\ncity.\\n\\nThe  German  V-2  missiles  fired  at  London  between\\nSeptember 1944 and March 1945 had a conventional high-\\nexplosive warhead and a very large CEP of some 17 km.\\nYet the 500 V-2s which hit London succeeded in causing\\nmore than 21,000 casualties and destroying about 200,000\\nhomes.\\n\\nWhen the West were crying themselves hoarse over the\\nNPT,  we  stressed  upon  building  competence  in  core\\nguidance  and  control  technologies  to  achieve  a  CEP  as\\nprecise as 50 m. With the success of the Prithvi trials, the\\ncold  reality  of  a  possible  strategic  strike  even  without  a\\nnuclear warhead had silenced the critics to whispers about\\na possible technology-conspiracy theory.\\n\\nThe  launch  of  Prithvi  sent  shock  waves  across  the\\nunfriendly  neighbouring  countries.  The  response  of  the\\nWestern bloc was initially one of shock and then of anger. A\\nseven-nation technology embargo was clamped, making it\\nimpossible \\nto  buy  anything  even  remotely\\nconnected  with  the  development  of  guided  missiles.  The\\nemergence of India as a self-reliant country in the field of\\nguided  missiles  upset  all  the  developed  nations  of  the\\nworld.\\n* * *\\n\\nIndia \\n\\nfor \\n\\n\\x0c14\\n\\n\\x0cTorchbearers\\n\\nIndian  core  competence  in  rocketry  has  been  firmly\\nestablished  again,  beyond  any  doubt.  The  robust  civilian\\nspace  industry  and  viable  missilebased  defences  has\\nbrought  India  into  the  select  club  of  nations  that  call\\nthemselves  superpowers.  Always  encouraged  to  follow\\nBuddha’s  or  Gandhi’s  teachings,  how  and  why  did  India\\nbecome  a  missile  power  is  a  question  that  needs  to  be\\nanswered for future generations.\\n\\nTwo  centuries  of  subjugation,  oppression  and  denial\\nhave failed to kill the creativity and capability of the Indian\\npeople. Within just a decade of gaining independence and\\nachieving  sovereignty,  Indian  Space  and  Atomic  Energy\\nProgrammes  were  launched  with  a  perfect  orientation\\ntowards peaceful applications. There were neither funds for\\ninvesting  in  missile  development  nor  any  established\\nrequirement \\nthe  Armed  Forces.  The  bitter\\nexperiences of 1962 forced us to take the basic first steps\\ntowards missile development.\\n\\nfrom \\n\\nthe \\n\\nWould  a  Prithvi  suffice?  Would \\n\\nindigenous\\ndevelopment  of  four  or  five  missile  systems  make  us\\nsufficiently strong? Or would having nuclear weapons make\\nus  stronger?  Missiles  and  atomic  weapons  are  merely\\nparts  of  a  greater  whole. As  I  saw  it,  the  development  of\\nPrithvi  represented  the  self-reliance  of  our  country  in  the\\nfield  of  advanced \\nis\\nsynonymous  with  huge  amounts  of  money  and  massive\\ninfrastructure. Neither of these was available, unfortunately,\\nin adequate measure. So what could we do? Perhaps the\\nAgni  missile  being  developed  as  a \\ntechnology\\ndemonstrator project, pooling all the resources available in\\nthe country, could provide an answer?\\n\\ntechnology.  High \\n\\ntechnology \\n\\nI was very sure, even when we discussed REX in ISRO\\nIndian  scientists  and\\nthat \\nabout  a  decade  ago, \\ntechnologists  working  together  had  the  capability \\nto\\nachieve  this  technological  breakthrough.  India  can  most\\ncertainly  achieve  state-of-the-art  technology  through  a\\ncombined  effort  of  the  scientific  laboratories  and  the\\nacademic  institutions.  If  one  can  liberate  Indian  industry\\nfrom  the  self-created  image  of  being  mere  fabricating\\nfactories,  they  can  implement  indigenously  developed\\ntechnology  and  attain  excellent  results.  To  do  this,  we\\nadopted \\nstrategy—  multi-institutional\\na \\nthe\\nparticipation, \\nempowering  technology.  These  were  the  stones  rubbed\\ntogether to create Agni.\\n\\nconsortium  approach,  and \\n\\nthreefold \\nthe \\n\\nThe  Agni  team  was  comprised  of  more  than  500\\nscientists.  Many  organizations  were  networked \\nto\\nundertake  this  huge  effort  of  launching  Agni.  The  Agni\\nmission  had  two  basic  orientations—  work  and  workers.\\nEach member was dependent on the others in his team to\\naccomplish his target. Contradiction and confusion are the\\ntwo things most likely to occur in such situations. Different\\nleaders  accommodate  concern  for  workers  while  getting\\nwork  done,  in  their  own  personal  ways.  Some  shed  all\\nconcern for workers in order to get results. They use people\\nmerely  as  instruments  to  reach  goals.  Some  give  less\\nimportance  to  the  work,  and  make  an  effort  to  gain  the\\nwarmth and approval of people working with them. But what\\nthis team achieved was the highest possible integration in\\nterms of both the quality of work and human relationships.\\n\\nInvolvement, participation and commitment were the key\\nwords to functioning. Each of the team members appeared\\nto be performing by choice. The launching of Agni was the\\n\\n\\x0cteam.  Dedicated \\n\\ncommon  stake  not  only  for  our  scientists,  but  for  their\\nfamilies  too.  VR  Nagaraj  was  the  leader  of  the  electrical\\nintegration \\nis,\\nNagaraj  would  forget  basic  requirements  like  food  and\\nsleep  while  on  the  integration  gig.  His  brother-in-law\\npassed  away  while  he  was  at  ITR.  His  family  kept  this\\ninformation  from  Nagaraj  so  that  there  would  be  no\\ninterruption in his work towards the launching of Agni.\\n\\ntechnologist \\n\\nthat  he \\n\\nthree \\n\\nThe Agni launch had been scheduled for 20 April 1989.\\nThis  was  going  to  be  an  unprecedented  exercise.  Unlike\\nspace  launch  vehicles,  a  missile  launch  involves  wide-\\nranging  safety  hazards.  Two  radars, \\ntelemetry\\nstations, one telecommand station and four electro-optical\\ntracking  instruments  to  monitor  the  missile  trajectory  had\\nbeen  deployed.  In  addition,  the  telemetry  station  at  Car\\nNicobar  (ISTRAC)  and  the  SHAR  radars  were  also\\ncommissioned  to  track  the  vehicle.  Dynamic  surveillance\\nwas employed to cover the electrical power that flows from\\nthe  missile  batteries  within  the  vehicle  and  to  control\\nsystem pressures. Should any deviation be noticed either\\nin voltage or in pressure, the specially designed automatic\\ncheckout system would signal “Hold”. The flight operations\\nwould  then  be  sequenced  only  if  the  defect  was  rectified.\\nThe  countdown  for  the  launch  started  at  T-36  hours.  The\\ncountdown  from  T-7.5  minutes  was  to  be  computer\\ncontrolled.\\n\\nAll activities preparatory to the launch went according to\\nschedule.  We  had  decided  to  move  the  people  living  in\\nnearby  villages  to  safety  at  the  time  of  the  launch.  This\\nattracted media attention, and led to much controversy. By\\nthe  time  20  April  1989  arrived,  the  whole  nation  was\\nwatching  us.  Foreign  pressure  was  exerted \\nthrough\\ndiplomatic  channels  to  abort  the  flight  trial,  but  the  Indian\\nGovernment stood behind us like a rock and staved off any\\ndistraction to our work. We were at T-14 seconds when the\\ncomputer  signalled  “Hold”,  indicating  that  one  of  the\\ninstruments  was \\nfunctioning  erratically.  This  was\\nimmediately  rectified.  Meanwhile,  the  down-range  station\\nasked for a “Hold”. In another few seconds, multiple Holds\\nwere  necessitated,  resulting  in  irreversible  internal  power\\nconsumption. We had to abort the launch. The missile had\\nto be opened up to replace the on-board power supplies. A\\nweeping Nagaraj, by now informed about the tragedy in his\\nfamily, met me and promised that he would be back within\\nthree  days.  The  profiles  of  these  courageous  people  will\\nnever  be  written  about  in  any  history  book,  but  it  is  such\\nsilent  people  on  whose  hard  work  generations  thrive  and\\nnations  progress.  Sending  Nagaraj  off,  I  met  my  team\\nmembers  who  were  in  a  state  of  shock  and  sorrow.  I\\nshared  my  SLV-3  experience  with  them.  “I  lost  my  launch\\nvehicle in the sea but recovered successfully. Your missile\\nis  in  front  of  you.  In  fact  you  have  lost  nothing  but  a  few\\nweeks of rework.” This shook them out of their immobility\\nand the entire team went back to retrieve the subsystems\\nand re-charge them.\\n\\nThe  press  was  up  in  arms,  and  fielded  various\\ninterpretations of the postponement of the flight to suit the\\nfancies of their readership. Cartoonist Sudhir Dar sketched\\na shopkeeper returning a product to the salesman saying\\nthat  like  Agni  it  would  not  take  off.  Another  cartoonist\\nshowed  one Agni  scientist  explaining  that  the  launch  was\\npostponed because the press button did not make contact.\\nThe  Hindustan  Times  showed  a  leader  consoling  press\\nreporters,  “There’s  no  need  for  any  alarm  ...  it’s  a  purely\\npeaceful, non-violent missile”.\\n\\nAfter a detailed analysis conducted virtually around the\\n\\n\\x0cclock  for  the  next  ten  days,  our  scientists  had  the  missile\\nready  for  launch  on  1  May  1989.  But,  again,  during  the\\nautomatic  computer  checkout  period  at  T10  seconds,  a\\nHold signal was indicated. A closer inspection showed that\\none  of  the  control  components,  S1-TVC  was  not  working\\naccording to the mission requirements. The launch had to\\nbe  postponed  yet  again.  Now,  such  things  are  very\\ncommon  in  rocketry  and  quite  often  happen  in  other\\ncountries too. But the expectant nation was in no mood to\\nappreciate our difficulties. The Hindu carried a cartoon by\\nKeshav  showing  a  villager  counting  some  currency  notes\\nand commenting to another, “Yes, it’s the compensation for\\nmoving  away  from  my  hut  near  the  test  site—a  few  more\\npostponements  and  I  can  build  a  house  of  my  own...”.\\nAnother  cartoonist  designated  Agni  as \\nIDBM—\\nIntermittently  Delayed  Ballistic  Missile.”  Amul’s  cartoon\\nsuggested that what Agni needed to do was use their butter\\nas fuel!\\n\\n“ \\n\\nI took some time off, leaving my team at ITR to talk to\\nthe DRDLRCI community. The entire DRDL-RCI community\\nassembled  after  working  hours  on  8  May  1989. \\nI\\naddressed the gathering of more than 2,000 persons, “Very\\nrarely  is  a  laboratory  or  an  R&D  establishment  given  an\\nopportunity to be the first in the country to develop a system\\nsuch  as Agni. A  great  opportunity  has  been  given  to  us.\\nNaturally  major  opportunities  are  accompanied  by  equally\\nmajor challenges. We should not give up and we should not\\nallow the problem to defeat us. The country doesn’t deserve\\nanything  less  than  success  from  us.  Let  us  aim  for\\nsuccess”. I had almost completed my address, when I found\\nmyself  telling  my  people,  “I  promise  you,  we  will  be  back\\nafter  successfully  launching  Agni  before  the  end  of  this\\nmonth.”\\n\\nDetailed  analysis  of  the  component  failure  during  the\\nsecond  attempt  led  to  the  refurbishment  of  the  control\\nsystem.  This  task  was  entrusted  to  a  DRDO-ISRO  team.\\nThe  team  carried  out  the  rectification  of  the  first  stage\\ncontrol  system  at  the  Liquid  Propellant  System  Complex\\n(LPSC) of ISRO and completed the task in record time with\\ntremendous  concentration  and  will-power.  It  was  nothing\\nshort  of  amazing  how  hundreds  of  scientists  and  staff\\nworked continuously and completed the system readiness\\nwith acceptance tests in just 10 days. The aircraft took off\\nfrom  Trivandrum  with  the  rectified  control  systems  and\\nlanded close to ITR on the eleventh day. But now it was the\\nturn of hostile weather conditions to impede us. A cyclone\\nthreat  was  looming  large.  All  the  work  centres  were\\nconnected  through  satellite  communication  and  HF  links.\\nMeteorological  data  started \\nten-minute\\nintervals.\\n\\nflowing \\n\\nin  at \\n\\nFinally, the launch was scheduled for 22 May 1989. The\\nprevious night, Dr Arunachalam, Gen KN Singh and I were\\nwalking  together  with  the  Defence  Minister  KC  Pant,  who\\nhad come to ITR to witness the launch. It was a full-moon\\nnight, it was high tide and the waves crashed and roared,\\nas  if  singing  of  His  glory  and  power.  Would  we  succeed\\nwith the Agni launch tomorrow? This question was foremost\\nin all our minds, but none of us was willing to break the spell\\ncast by the beautiful moonlit night. Breaking a long silence,\\nthe Defence Minister finally asked me, “Kalam! what would\\nyou like me to do to celebrate the Agni success tomorrow?”\\nIt  was  a  simple  question,  to  which  I  could  not  think  of  an\\nanswer immediately. What did I want? What was it that I did\\nnot have? What could make me happier? And then I found\\nthe answer. “We need 100,000 saplings to plant at RCI,” I\\n\\n\\x0csaid. His face lit up with a friendly glow. “You are buying the\\nblessings of Mother Earth for Agni,” Defence Minister KC\\nPant quipped. “We will succeed tomorrow”, he predicted.\\n\\nThe next day Agni took off at 0710 hrs. It was a perfect\\nlaunch. The missile followed a textbook trajectory. All flight\\nparameters were met. It was like waking up to a beautiful\\nmorning  from  a  nightmarish  sleep.  We  had  reached  the\\nlaunch  pad  after  five  years  of  continuous  work  at  multiple\\nwork centres. We had lived through the ordeal of a series of\\nsnags  in  the  last  five  weeks.  We  had  survived  pressure\\nfrom  everywhere  to  stop  the  whole  thing.  But  we  did  it  at\\nlast! It was one of the greatest moments of my life. A mere\\n600 seconds of elegant flight washed off our entire fatigue\\nin an instant. What a wonderful culmination of our years of\\nlabour. I wrote in my diary that night:\\n\\nDo not look at Agni\\nas an entity directed upward\\nto deter the ominous\\nor exhibit your might.\\nIt is fire\\nin the heart of an Indian.\\nDo not even give it\\nthe form of a missile\\nas it clings to the\\nburning pride of this nation\\nand thus is bright.\\n\\nPrime  Minister  Rajiv  Gandhi  called  the Agni  launch  “a\\nmajor  achievement  in  our  continuing  efforts  to  safeguard\\nour  independence  and  security  by  self-reliant  means.  The\\ntechnology demonstration through Agni is a reflection of our\\ncommitment  to  the  indigenous  development  of  advanced\\ntechnologies  for  the  nation’s  defence.”  “The  country  is\\nproud of your efforts,” he told me. President Venkataraman\\nsaw  in  the  Agni  success  the  fulfilment  of  his  dream.  He\\ncabled from Simla, “It is a tribute to your dedication, hard\\nwork, and talent.”\\n\\nA great deal of misinformation and disinformation had\\nbeen  spread  by  vested  interests  about  this  technology\\nmission. Agni had never been intended only as a nuclear\\nweapon system. What it did was to afford us the option of\\ndeveloping the ability to deliver non-nuclear weapons with\\nhigh  precision  at  long  ranges.  That  it  provided  us  with  a\\nviable  nonnuclear  option  was  of  the  greatest  relevance  to\\ncontemporary strategic doctrines.\\n\\nGreat ire was raised by the test firing of Agni, according\\nto a wellknown American defence journal, especially in the\\nUnited  States  where  Congressmen  threatened  to  put  a\\nstop to all dual-use and missile-related technologies, along\\nwith all multinational aid.\\n\\nGary  Milhollin,  a  so-called  specialist  in  missiles  and\\nwarhead  technologies,  had  made  a  claim  in  The  Wall\\nStreet  Journal  that  India  had  made Agni  with  the  help  of\\nWest  Germany.  I  had  a  hearty  laugh  reading  that  the\\nGerman  Aerospace  Research  Establishment  (DLR)  had\\ndeveloped Agni’s guidance system, the first-stage rocket,\\nand  a  composite  nose  cone,  and  that  the  aerodynamic\\nmodel  of  Agni  was  tested  in  the  DLR  wind  tunnel.  An\\nimmediate  denial  came  from  the  DLR,  who  in  turn\\nspeculated  that  France  had  supplied  the  Agni  guidance\\nelectronics. American Senator Jeff Bingaman even went to\\nthe extent of suggesting that I picked up everything needed\\nfor  Agni  during  my  four-month  stay  at  Wallop’s  Island  in\\n1962. The fact that I was in Wallop’s Island more than 25\\nyears ago and at that time the technology used in Agni did\\nnot exist even in the United States was not mentioned.\\n\\n\\x0cIn  today’s  world,  technological  backwardness  leads  to\\nsubjugation. Can we allow our freedom to be compromised\\non  this  account?  It  is  our  bounden  duty  to  guarantee  the\\nsecurity  and  integrity  of  our  nation  against  this  threat.\\nShould we not uphold the mandate bequeathed to us by our\\nforefathers who fought for the liberation of our country from\\nimperialism? Only when we are technologically self-reliant\\nwill we able to fulfill their dream.\\n\\nTill the Agni launch, the Indian Armed Forces had been\\nstructured  for  a  strictly  defensive  role  to  safeguard  our\\nnation,  to  shield  our  democratic  processes  from  the\\nturbulence in the countries around us and to raise the cost\\nof  any  external  intervention  to  an  unacceptable  level  for\\ncountries  which  may  entertain  such  notions.  With  Agni,\\nIndia had reached the stage where she had the option of\\npreventing wars involving her.\\n\\nAgni  marked  the  completion  of  five  years  of  IGMDP.\\nNow that it had demonstrated our competence in the crucial\\narea  of  re-entry  technology  and  with  tactical  missiles  like\\nPrithvi  and  Trishul  already  testfired,  the  launches  of  Nag\\nand Akash would take us into areas of competence where\\nthere  is  little  or  no  international  competition.  These  two\\nmissile  systems  contained  within  themselves  the  stuff  of\\nmajor  technological  breakthroughs.  There  was  a  need  to\\nfocus our efforts more intensively on them.\\n\\nIn  September  1989,  I  was  invited  by  the  Maharashtra\\nAcademy of Sciences in Bombay to deliver the Jawaharlal\\nNehru  Memorial  Lecture.  I  used  this  opportunity  to  share\\nwith  the  budding  scientists  my  plans  of  making  an\\nindigenous Air-to-Air  missile, Astra.  It  would  dovetail  with\\nthe development of the Indian Light Combat Aircraft (LCA).\\nI  told  them  that  our  work  in  Imaging  Infra  Red  (IIR)  and\\nMillimetric  Wave  (MMW)  radar  technology  for  the  Nag\\nmissile  system  had  placed  us \\nthe  vanguard  of\\ninternational R&D efforts in missile technology. I also drew\\ntheir  attention  to  the  crucial  role  that  carbon-carbon  and\\nother advanced composite materials play in mastering the\\nre-entry \\nthe  conclusion  of  a\\ntechnological  effort  that  was  given  its  start  by  Prime\\nMinister Indira Gandhi when the country decided to break\\ntechnological\\nfree \\nbackwardness  and  slough  off \\nthe  dead  skin  of\\nsubordination to industrialized nations.\\n\\ntechnology.  Agni  was \\n\\nthe  paralysing \\n\\nfetters  of \\n\\nfrom \\n\\nin \\n\\nThe  second  flight  of  Prithvi  at  the  end  of  September\\n1988 was again a great success. Prithvi has proved to be\\nthe best surface-to-surface missile in the world today. It can\\ncarry  1000  kg  of  warhead  to  a  distance  of  250  km  and\\ndeliver  it  within  a  radius  of  50  metres.  Through  computer\\ncontrolled  operations,  numerous  warhead  weight  and\\ndelivery distance combinations can be achieved in a very\\nshort time and in battlefield conditions. It is a hundred per\\ncent \\nin  all  respects—design,  operations,\\ndeployment.  It  can  be  produced  in  large  numbers  as  the\\nproduction  facilities  at  BDL  were  concurrently  developed\\nduring the development phase itself. The Army was quick to\\nrecognize  the  potential  of  this  commendable  effort  and\\napproached  the  CCPA  for  placing  orders  for  Prithvi  and\\nTrishul  missile  systems,  something \\nthat  had  never\\nhappened before.\\n* * * WINGS OF FIRE ORIENTATION - 1\\n\\nindigenous \\n\\n\\x0cIV\\n\\n\\x0cCONTEMPLATION\\n\\n[ 1991 – ]\\n\\nWe create and destroy\\n\\nAnd again recreate\\nIn forms of which no one knows.\\nAL-WAQUIAH Qur’an 56:61\\n\\n\\x0c15\\n\\n\\x0cEmancipators\\n\\nO\\n\\nn Republic Day 1990, the nation celebrated the success\\nof  its  missile  programme.  I  was  conferred  the  Padma\\nVibhushan  along  with  Dr  Arunachalam.  Two  of  my  other\\ncolleagues—\\n\\nJC  Bhattacharya  and  RN  Agarwal—were  also\\ndecorated  with  the  Padma  Shree  awards.  It  was  the  first\\ntime  in  the  history  of  free  India  that  so  many  scientists\\naffiliated to the same organization found their names on the\\nawards list. Memories of the Padma Bhushan awarded a\\ndecade ago came alive. I still lived more or less as I had\\nlived  then—in  a  room  ten  feet  wide  and  twelve  feet  long,\\nfurnished  mainly  with  books,  papers  and  a  few  pieces  of\\nhired  furniture.  The  only  difference  was  at  that  time,  my\\nroom was in Trivandrum and now it was in Hyderabad. The\\nmess  bearer  brought  me  my  breakfast  of  idlis  and\\nbuttermilk and smiled in silent congratulation for the award.\\nI  was  touched  by  the  recognition  bestowed  on  me  by  my\\ncountrymen.  A  large  number  of  scientists  and  engineers\\nleave  this  country  at  their  first  opportunity  to  earn  more\\nmoney  abroad.  It  is  true  that  they  definitely  get  greater\\nmonetary benefits, but could anything compensate for this\\nlove and respect from one’s own countrymen?\\nI sat alone for a while in silent contemplation. The sand and\\nshells of\\n\\nthe  care  of \\n\\nRameswaram, \\n\\nIyadurai  Solomon \\n\\nin\\nRamanathapuram, the guidance of Rev. Father Sequeira in\\nTrichi and Prof. Pandalai in Madras, the encouragement of\\nDr  Mediratta  in  Bangalore,  the  hovercraft  ride  with  Prof.\\nMenon,  the  pre-dawn  visit  to  the  Tilpat  Range  with  Prof.\\nSarabhai,  the  healing  touch  of  Dr  Brahm  Prakash  on  the\\nday of the SLV3 failure, the national jubilation on the SLV-3\\nlaunch, Madam Gandhi’s appreciative smile, the post-SLV-\\n3 simmering at VSSC, Dr Ramanna’s faith in inviting me to\\nDRDO,  the  IGMDP,  the  creation  of  RCI,  Prithvi,  Agni...a\\nflood  of  memories  swept  over  me.  Where  were  all  these\\nmen now? My father, Prof. Sarabhai, Dr Brahm Prakash? I\\nwished I could meet them and share my joy with them. I felt\\nthe paternal forces of heaven and the maternal and cosmic\\nforces  of  nature  embrace  me  as  parents  would  hug  their\\nlong-lost child. I scribbled in my diary:\\n\\nAway! fond thoughts, and vex my soul no more!\\n\\nWork claimed my wakeful nights, my busy days\\nAlbeit brought memories of Rameswaram shore\\nYet haunt my dreaming gaze!\\n\\nA  fortnight  later,  Iyer  and  his  team  celebrated  the\\nawards for the missile programme with the maiden flight of\\nNag.  They  repeated  the  feat  again  on  the  very  next  day,\\nthus  testing  twice  over  the  first  Indian  all-composite\\nairframe  and  the  propulsion  system.  These  tests  also\\nproved the worth of the indigenous thermal batteries.\\n\\nIndia  had  achieved  the  status  of  having  a  third\\ngeneration  anti-tank  missile  system  with  ‘fire-and-forget’\\ncapability—on par with any stateof-the-art technology in the\\nworld.  Indigenous  composite  technology  had  achieved  a\\nmajor  milestone.  The  success  of  Nag  also  confirmed  the\\nefficacy of the consortium approach, which had led to the\\nsuccessful development of Agni.\\n\\nNag uses two key technologies—an Imaging Infra Red\\n(IIR)  system  and  a  Millimetric  Wave  (MMW)  seeker  radar\\nas  its  guiding  eye.  No  single  laboratory  in  the  country\\npossessed  the  capability  of  developing  these  highly\\n\\n\\x0cadvanced systems. But the urge to succeed existed, which\\nresulted in a very effective joint effort. The Semi Conductor\\nComplex  at  Chandigarh  developed  the  Charge  Coupled\\nDevices (CCD) array. The Solid Physics Laboratory, Delhi,\\nmade  the  matching  Mercury  Cadmium  Telluride  (MCT)\\ndetectors. The Defence Science Centre (DSC), Delhi, put\\ntogether an indigenous cooling system based on the Joules\\nThomson  effect.

When \\n\\nI went to Madurai Kamaraj University the same month to\\ndeliver \\nI  reached\\nMadurai,  I  asked  after  my  high  school  teacher  Iyadurai\\nSolomon,  who  was  by  now  a  Reverend  and  eighty  years\\nold. I was told that he lived in a suburb of Madurai, so I took\\na taxi and looked for his house. Rev. Solomon knew that I\\nwas  going  to  give  the  convocation  address  that  day.\\nHowever,  he  had  no  way  of  getting  there.  There  was  a\\ntouching  reunion  between  teacher  and  pupil.  Dr  PC\\nAlexander, the Governor of Tamil Nadu, who was presiding\\nover the function, was deeply moved on seeing the elderly\\nteacher  who  had  not  forgotten  his  pupil  of  long  ago,  and\\nrequested him to share the dais.\\n\\n“Every  convocation  day  of  every  University  is  like\\nopening the floodgates of energy which, once harnessed by\\ninstitutions,  organ-izations  and  industry,  aids  in  nation-\\nbuilding,” I told the young graduates. Somehow I felt I was\\nechoing  Rev.  Solomon’s  words,  spoken  about  half  a\\ncentury  ago.  After  my  lecture,  I  bowed  down  before  my\\nteacher.  “Great  dreams  of  great  dreamers  are  always\\ntranscended,”  I  told  Rev.  Solomon.  “You  have  not  only\\nreached my goals, Kalam! You have eclipsed them,” he told\\nme in a voice choked with emotion.\\n\\nThe next month, I happened to be in Trichi and used that\\nopportunity to visit St. Joseph’s College. I did not find Rev.\\nFather Sequeira, Rev. Father Erhart, Prof. Subramanyam,\\nProf. Iyyamperumal Konar, or Prof. Thothathri Iyengar there,\\nbut  it  seemed  to  me  that  the  stones  of  the  St.  Joseph’s\\nbuilding still carried the imprint of the wisdom of those great\\npeople. I shared with the young students my memories of\\nSt.  Joseph’s  and  paid  tribute  to  the  teachers  who  had\\nmoulded me.\\n\\nWe  celebrated  the  nation’s  forty-fourth  Independence\\nDay  with  the  test  firing  of Akash.  Prahlada  and  his  team\\nevaluated a new solid propellant booster system based on\\na  composite  modified  double  base  propellant.  This\\npropellant  with  its  unprecedented  high  energy  properties\\nwas  crucial  in  assuring  the  long-range  surface-to-air\\nmissiles.  The  country  had  taken  an  important  step  in\\nground-based air defence of vulnerable areas.\\n\\nTowards \\n\\nthe  end  of  1990,  Jadavpur  University\\nconferred  on  me  the  honour  of  Doctor  of  Science  at  a\\nspecial  convocation.  I  was  a  little  embarrassed  at  finding\\nmy name mentioned along with that of the legendary Nelson\\nMandela, who was also honoured at the same convocation.\\nWhat could I possible have in common with a legend like\\nMandela? Perhaps it was our persistence in our missions.\\nMy  mission  of  advancing  rocketry  in  my  country  was\\nperhaps nothing when compared with Mandela’s mission of\\nachieving  dignity  for  a  great  mass  of  humanity;  but  there\\nwas no difference in the intensity of our passions. “Be more\\n\\n\\x0cdedicated  to  making  solid  achievements  than  in  running\\nafter swift but synthetic happiness,” was my advice to the\\nyoung audience.\\n\\nThe Missile Council declared 1991 the Year of Initiative\\nfor DRDL and RCI. When we chose the route of concurrent\\nengineering in IGMDP, we selected a rough track. With the\\ncompletion  of  developmental  trials  on  Prithvi  and  Trishul,\\nour  choice  was  on  test  now.  I  exhorted  my  colleagues  to\\ncommence  user  trials  within  the  year.  I  knew  that  it  was\\ngoing  to  be  a  tough  task,  but  that  was  not  going  to\\ndiscourage us.\\n\\nRear  Admiral  Mohan  retired  and  his  deputy,  Kapoor,\\nwas  to  take  over  Trishul.  I  had  always  admired  Mohan’s\\nunderstanding  of  missile  command  guidance.  This  sailor-\\nteacher-scientist could outwit any other expert in the country\\nin this field. I will always remember his candid exposition of\\nvarious  aspects  of  the  Command  Line  of  Sight  (CLOS)\\nguidance  system  during  the  Trishul  meetings.  Once,  he\\nshowed me a verse that he had composed to highlight the\\nwoes of an IGMDP Project Director. It was a good way of\\nletting off steam:\\n\\nI mpossible timeframes,\\n\\nPERT charts to boot\\nAre driving me almost crazy as a coot;\\nPresentations to MC add to one’s woes,\\nIf they solve anything, Heaven only knows.\\nMeetings on holidays, even at night,\\nThe family is fed up,\\nAnd all ready to fight.\\nMy hands are itching\\nto tear my hair —\\nBut alas! I haven’t any more to tear ...\\n\\nI  told  him,  “I  have  handed  over  all  my  problems  to  my\\nbest  teams  in  DRDL,  RCI,  and  other  participating  labs.\\nThat has given me a full head of hair.”\\n\\nThe year 1991 began on a very ominous note. On the\\nnight of 15 January 1991, the Gulf War broke out between\\nIraq and the Allied Forces led by the USA. In one stroke,\\nthanks  to  satellite  television  invading  Indian  skies  by  that\\ntime, rockets and missiles captured the imagination of the\\nentire  nation.  People  started  discussing  Scuds  and\\nPatriots  in  coffee  houses  and  tea  shops.  Children  began\\nflying  paper  kites  shaped  like  missiles,  and  playing  war\\ngames  along  the  lines  of  what  they  saw  on  American\\ntelevision networks. The successful test firing of Prithvi and\\nTrishul  during  the  course  of  the  Gulf  War  was  enough  to\\nmake  an  anxious  nation  relax.  The  newspaper  reports  of\\nthe  programmable  trajectory  capability  of  the  Prithvi  and\\nTrishul  guidance  system,  using  microwave  frequencies  in\\nvirtually \\ncreated  widespread\\nbands, \\nawareness.  The  nation  was  quick  to  draw  parallels\\nbetween the missiles operational in the Gulf War and our\\nown warhead carriers. A common query I encountered was\\nwhether  Prithvi  was  superior  to  a  Scud,  whether  Akash\\ncould perform like a Patriot, and so on. Hearing a “Yes” or\\na “Why not?” from me, people’s faces would light up with\\npride and satisfaction.\\n\\nunjammable \\n\\nThe Allied Forces had a marked technological edge, as\\nthey  were  fielding  systems  built  using  the  technologies  of\\nthe eighties and nineties. Iraq was fighting with the by-and-\\nlarge vintage weapon systems of the sixties and seventies.\\nNow,  this  is  where  the  key  to  the  modern  world  order\\nlies— superiority through technology. Deprive the opponent\\nof  the  latest  technology  and  then  dictate  your  terms  in  an\\nunequal  contest.  When  the  Chinese  war  philosopher,  Sun\\n\\n\\x0cTzu  ruminated  over  2000  years  ago  that  what  matters  in\\nwar  is  not  decimating  the  enemy  army  physically  but\\nbreaking his will so as to make him concede defeat in the\\nmind,  he  seems  to  have  visualized  the  domination  of\\ntechnology  in  the  twentieth  century  theatres  of  war.  The\\nmissile  force  coupled  with  the  electronic  warfare  used  in\\nthe  Gulf  War  was  a  feast  for  military  strategic  experts.  It\\nacted  as  a  curtainraiser  for  the  twenty-first  century  war\\nscenario  with  missiles  and  electronic  and  information\\nwarfare playing the lead roles.\\n\\nIn  India,  even  today,  the  term  technology,  for  most\\npeople, conjures up images of smoky steel mills or clanking\\nmachines. This is a rather inadequate conception of what\\ntechnology denotes. The invention of the horse collar in the\\nMiddle Ages led to major changes in agricultural methods,\\nand was as much a technological advance as the invention\\nof \\nlater.  Moreover,\\ntechnology  includes  techniques  as  well  as  the  machines\\nthat may or may not be necessary to apply them. It includes\\nways to make chemical reactions occur, ways to breed fish,\\neradicate  weeds,  light  theatres,  treat  patients,  teach\\nhistory, fight wars, or even prevent them.\\n\\nfurnace  centuries \\n\\nthe  Bessemer \\n\\nToday,  most  advanced  technological  processes  are\\ncarried out far from assembly lines or open hearths. Indeed,\\nin  electronics,  in  space  technology,  in  most  of  the  new\\nindustries,  relative  silence  and  clean  surroundings  are\\ncharacteristic,  even  essential.  The  assembly  line,  with  the\\norganization of armies of men, to carry out simple, routine\\nfunctions  is  an  anachronism.  Our  symbols  of  technology\\nmust  change  before  we  can  keep  pace  with  changes  in\\ntechnology  itself.  We  should  never  forget  that  technology\\nfeeds  on  itself.  Technology  makes  more \\ntechnology\\npossible. In fact, technological innovation consists of three\\nstages  linked  together  in  a  self-reinforcing  cycle.  First,\\nthere is the creative stage, with the blueprint of a feasible\\nidea. This is made real by its practical application, and this\\nfinally ends in its diffusion through society. The process is\\nthen  complete;  the  loop  is  closed  when  the  diffusion  of\\ntechnology  embodying  the  new  idea  in  its  turn  helps\\ngenerate new creative ideas. Today, all over the developed\\nworld, the time gap between each of the steps in this cycle\\nhas  been  shortened.  In  India,  we  are  just  progressing\\ntowards that stage—closing the loop.\\n\\nAfter  the  Gulf  War  concluded  with  the  victory  of  the\\ntechnologically superior Allied Forces, over 500 scientists\\nof  DRDL  and  RCI  gathered  to  discuss  issues  that  had\\nemerged.  I  posed  a  question  before  the  assembly:  was\\ntechnology or weapon symmetry with other nations feasible,\\nand  if  so,  should  it  be  attempted?  The  discussion  led  to\\nmany  more  serious  questions,  such  as,  how  to  establish\\neffective electronic warfare support? How to make missile\\ndevelopment  proceed  apace  with  the  development  of\\nequally necessary systems like the LCA; and what were the\\nkey areas where a push would bring progress?\\n\\nAt  the  end  of  a  lively  discussion  spread  over  three\\nhours,  the  consensus  emerged  that  there  was  no  way  to\\nredress asymmetry in military capability except to have the\\nsame  capability  in  specific  areas  as  your  potential\\nopponent. The scientists vowed to achieve a reduced CEP\\nin the accuracy of Prithvi’s delivery, perfecting the Ka band\\nguidance system for Trishul and realising all carbon-carbon\\nre-entry control surfaces for Agni by the end of the year. The\\nvow was later fulfilled. The year also saw tubelaunched Nag\\nflights, and the manoeuvre of Trishul at seven metres above\\nsea level, at speeds which exceeded three times the speed\\nof sound. The latter was a breakthrough in the development\\n\\n\\x0cof an indigenous ship-launched anti-sea-skimmer missile.\\n\\nThe  same  year,  I  received  an  honorary  degree  of\\nDoctor of Science from the IIT, Bombay. In the citation read\\nby  Prof.  B  Nag  on  the  occasion,  I  was  described  as  “an\\ninspiration  behind  the  creation  of  a  solid  technological\\nbase from which India’s future aerospace programmes can\\nbe  launched  to  meet  the  challenges  of  the  twenty-first\\ncentury”. Well, perhaps Prof. Nag was only being polite, but\\nI do believe that India will enter the next century with its own\\nsatellite in geo-stationary orbit 36,000 km away in space,\\npositioned by its own launch vehicle. India will also become\\na missile power. Ours is a country with tremendous vitality.\\nEven though the world may not see its full potential or feel\\nits full power, no one dare ignore it any more.\\n\\nOn  15  October,  I  turned  sixty.  I  looked  forward  to\\nretirement  and  planned  to  open  a  school  for  the  less\\nprivileged children. My friend, Prof. P Rama Rao, who was\\nheading the Department of Science and Technology in the\\nGovernment of India, even struck up a partnership with me\\nto establish what he called the Rao-Kalam school. We were\\nunanimous in our opinion that carrying out certain missions\\nand  reaching  certain  milestones,  however  important  they\\nmay be or however impressive they might appear to be, is\\nnot all there is to life. But we had to postpone our plan as\\nneither of us was relieved from our post by the Government\\nof India.\\nIt  was  during  this  period  that  I  decided  to  put  down  my\\nmemoirs  and  express  my  observations  and  opinions  on\\ncertain issues.\\n\\nThe  biggest  problem  Indian  youth  faced,  I  felt,  was  a\\nlack of clarity of vision, a lack of direction. It was then that I\\ndecided to write about the circumstances and people who\\nmade me what I am today; the idea was not merely to pay\\ntribute  to  some  individuals  or  highlight  certain  aspects  of\\nmy  life.  What  I  wanted  to  say  was  that  no  one,  however\\npoor,  underprivileged  or  small,  need  feel  disheartened\\nabout  life.  Problems  are  a  part  of  life.  Suffering  is  the\\nessence of success. As someone said:\\n\\nGod has not promised\\n\\nSkies always blue,\\nFlower-strewn pathways\\nAll our life through;\\nGod has not promised\\nSun without rain,\\nJoy without sorrow,\\nPeace without pain.\\n\\nI will not be presumptuous enough to say that my life can\\nbe a role model for anybody; but some poor child living in\\nan obscure place, in an underprivileged social setting may\\nfind a little solace in the way my destiny has been shaped. It\\ncould perhaps help such children liberate themselves from\\nthe  bondage  of \\nillusory  backwardness  and\\nhopelessness. Irrespective of where they are right now, they\\nshould be aware that God is with them and when He is with\\nthem, who can be against them?\\nBut God has promised\\n\\ntheir \\n\\nStrength for the day,\\nRest for the labour\\nLight for the way.\\n\\nIt  has  been  my  observation  that  most  Indians  suffer\\nunnecessary misery all their lives because they do not know\\nhow  to  manage  their  emotions.  They  are  paralysed  by\\nsome sort of a psychological inertia. Phrases like ‘the next\\nbest alternative’, ‘the only feasible option or solution’, and\\n‘till things take a turn for the better’ are commonplace in our\\n\\n\\x0cbusiness  conversations.  Why  not  write  about  the  deep-\\nrooted  character  traits  which  manifest  themselves  in  such\\nwidespread,  selfdefeatist  thought  patterns  and  negative\\nbehaviour? \\nI  have  worked  with  many  people  and\\norganizations and have had to deal with people who were\\nso full of their own limitations that they had no other way to\\nprove their self-worth than by intimidating me. Why not write\\nabout the victimization which is a hallmark of the tragedy of\\nIndian science and technology? And about the pathways to\\norganizational  success?  Let  the  latent  fire  in  the  heart  of\\nevery  Indian  acquire  wings,  and  the  glory  of  this  great\\ncountry light up the sky.\\n* * *\\n\\n\\x0c16\\n\\n\\x0cLeaders\\n\\nT\\n\\nechnology,  unlike  science,  is  a  group  activity.  It  is  not\\nbased  on  individual  intelligence,  but  on  the  interaction  of\\nmany people. I think the biggest success of IGMDP is not\\nthe fact that in\\n\\nrecord  time  the  country  acquired  the  capability  of\\nmaking five state-ofthe-art missile systems but that through\\nit,  some  superb  teams  of  scientists  and  engineers  have\\nbeen  created.  If  someone  asks  me  about  my  personal\\nachievements  in  Indian  rocketry,  I  would  put  it  down  to\\nhaving  created  a  challenging  environment  for  teams  of\\nyoung people to work in.\\n\\nIn their formative stages, teams are much like children\\nin spirit. They are as excitable, as full of vitality, enthusiasm,\\ncuriosity  and  the  desire  to  please  and  excel.  As  with\\nchildren,  however, \\nthese  positive  attributes  can  be\\ndestroyed  by  the  behaviour  of  misguided  parents.  For\\nteams to be successful, the environment must offer scope\\nfor innovation. I confronted many such challenges during the\\ncourse  of  my  work  at  DTD&P  (Air),  ISRO,  DRDO  and\\nelsewhere,  but  always  ensured \\nteams  an\\nenvironment which allowed innovation and risk-taking.\\n\\nfor  my \\n\\nfound \\n\\nthemselves \\n\\nWhen we first began creating project teams during the\\nSLV-3 project and later in IGMDP, people working in these\\nteams \\ntheir\\norganizations’  ambitions.  Since  a  great  deal  of\\npsychological investment had been made in these teams,\\nthey became both highly visible and highly vulnerable. They\\nwere  personally  expected  to  make  a  disproportionate\\ncontribution to win collective glory.\\n\\nfrontline  of \\n\\nthe \\n\\nin \\n\\nI was aware that any failure in the organizational support\\nsystem  would  negate  the  investment  in  team  strategies.\\nThe  teams  would  be  relegated  to  the  league  of  average\\nworking groups and might fail even there, unable to meet\\nthe high expectations set for them. On several occasions,\\nthe  organization  was  on  the  verge  of  losing  its  nerve  and\\nimposing  restraints.  The  high  level  of  uncertainty  and\\ncomplexity associated with team activity very often proves\\nto be a trap for the unwary.\\n\\nIn  the  early  years  of  the  SLV-3  project,  I  often  had  to\\ncounter  nervousness  of  the  top  people  because  progress\\nwas  not  tangibly  or  immediately  visible.  Many  felt  that  the\\norganization  had  lost  control  over  SLV-3,  that  the  team\\nwould run on unchecked, and cause chaos and confusion.\\nBut  on  all  occasions,  these  fears  were  proved  imaginary.\\nThere  were  many  people \\nin\\norganizations, for example at VSSC, who underestimated\\nour  responsibility  and  commitment \\nto  organizational\\nobjectives. Dealing with such people was a crucial part of\\nthe whole operation, and this was performed dexterously by\\nDr Brahm Prakash.\\n\\nin  powerful  positions \\n\\nWhen you work as a project team, you need to develop\\na  complex  view  of  the  success  criteria.  There  are  always\\nmultiple and often conflicting sets of expectations that exist\\nabout a team’s performance. Then, quite often, the project\\nteams  are  virtually \\nto\\ntorn  apart \\nin \\nthe  needs  and  constraints  of  sub-\\naccommodate \\ncontractors  outside \\nthe  organization  and  specialist\\ndepartments  within  the  organization.  Good  project  teams\\nare  able  to  quickly  identify  the  key  person  or  people  with\\nwhom negotiations must take place. A crucial aspect of the\\nteam leader’s role is to negotiate with these key people for\\ntheir  requirements,  and  to  ensure  that  the  dialogue\\n\\ntheir  attempt \\n\\n\\x0ccontinues  on  a  regular  basis  as  the  situation  develops  or\\nchanges.  If  there  is  one  thing  outsiders  dislike,  it  is\\nunpleasant  surprises.  Good  teams  ensure  that  there  are\\nnone.\\n\\nThe SLV-3 team developed their own internal success\\ncriteria.  We  articulated  our  standards,  expectations  and\\nobjectives.  We  summarised  what  was  needed  to  happen\\nfor  us  to  be  successful  and  how  we  would  measure\\nsuccess. For instance, how we were going to accomplish\\nour  tasks,  who  would  do  what  and  according  to  what\\nstandards,  what  were  the  time  limits  and  how  would  the\\nteam  conduct  itself  with  reference  to  others  in  the\\norganization.\\n\\nThe process of arriving at the success criteria within a\\nteam is an intricate and skilled one because there are a lot\\nof  things  going  on  below  the  surface.  On  the  surface,  the\\nteam is simply working to achieve the project’s goals. But I\\nhave repeatedly seen how people are poor at articulating\\nwhat  they  want—until  they  see  a  work  centre  doing\\nsomething  they  don’t  want  them  to  do.  A  project  team\\nmember must in fact act like a detective. He should probe\\nfor  clues  as  to  how  the  project  is  proceeding,  and  then\\npiece together different bits of evidence to build up a clear,\\ncomprehensive  and  deep  understanding  of  the  project’s\\nrequirements.\\n\\nlevel,  each  side  should  assess \\n\\nAt  another  level,  the  relationship  between  the  project\\nteams  and  the  work  centres  should  be  encouraged  and\\ndeveloped by the project leader. Both parties must be very\\nclear in their minds about their mutual interdependence and\\nthe fact that both of them have a stake in the project. At yet\\nanother \\nthe  other’s\\ncapabilities and identify areas of strength and weakness in\\norder to plan what needs doing and how it should be done.\\nIn  fact,  the  whole  game  can  be  seen  as  a  process  of\\ncontracting.  It  is  about  exploring  and  arriving  at  an\\nagreement on what each party expects of the other; about\\nrealistically understanding the constraints of the other party;\\nand  about  communicating  the  success  criteria  while\\ndefining some simple rules about how the relationship is to\\nwork; but above all, it’s the best means of developing clarity\\nin the relationship, both at the technical and personal levels,\\nin  order  to  avoid  any  nasty  surprises  in  the  future.  In\\nIGMDP,  Sivathanu  Pillai  and  his \\nteam  did  some\\nremarkable  work  in  this  area  through  their  home-grown\\ntechnique,  PACE,  which  stands  for  Programme Analysis,\\nControl and Evaluation. Each day between 12 noon and 1\\np.m.,  they  would  sit  with  a  project  team  and  a  particular\\nwork  centre  that  was  on  the  critical  path  and  assess  the\\nlevel  of  success  among  themselves.  The  excitement  of\\nplanning ways to succeed and the vision of future success\\nprovide  an  irresistible  form  of  motivation  which,  I  have\\nfound, always makes things happen.\\n\\nThe concept of Technology Management has its roots in\\nthe  Developmental  Management  models  which  originated\\nin  the  early  Sixties  out  of  a  conflict  between  harmony-\\nseeking and output-oriented management structures. There\\nare basically two types of management orientations: primal,\\nwhich  values  an  economic  employee,  and  rational,  which\\nvalues  an  organizational  employee.  My  concept  of\\nmanagement  is  woven  around  an  employee  who  is  a\\ntechnology  person.  While  the  primal  management  school\\nrecognizes  people  for  their  independence,  and  rational\\nmanagement acknowledges them for their dependability, I\\nvalue them for their interdependence. Whereas the primal\\nmanager  champions \\nthe\\nI  moot\\nrational  manager \\n\\nindependent  enterprise  and \\ncooperation, \\nserves \\n\\n\\x0cinterdependent  joint  ventures,  getting  the  forces  together,\\nnetworking people, resources, time schedules, costs, and\\nso on.\\n\\ninto \\n\\nindividual \\n\\nthe  system  of \\n\\nthe  concept  of  “Small \\n\\nAbraham  Maslow  was  the  first  person  to  suggest  the\\nnew psychology of self-actualization at a conceptual level. In\\nEurope,  Rudolf  Steiner  and  Reg  Revans  developed  this\\nconcept \\nlearning  and\\norganizational  renewal.  The  Anglo-German  management\\nintroduced  Buddhist\\nphilosopher,  Fritz  Schumacher \\neconomics  and  authored \\nis\\nBeautiful”.  In  the  Indian  subcontinent,  Mahatma  Gandhi\\nemphasized  grass  root  level  technology  and  put  the\\ncustomer at the centre of the entire business activity. JRD\\nTata  brought  in  progressdriven  infrastructure.  Dr  Homi\\nJehangir Bhabha and Prof. Vikram Sarabhai launched the\\ntechnology-based  atomic  energy  and  space\\nhigh, \\nprogrammes with a clear-cut emphasis on the natural laws\\nof \\nthe  developmental\\nphilosophy  of  Dr  Bhabha  and  Prof.  Sarabhai,  Dr  MS\\nSwaminathan  ushered  the  Green  Revolution  into  India\\nworking  on  another  natural  principle  of  integrity.  Dr\\nVerghese  Kurien  brought \\nin  a  powerful  cooperative\\nmovement  through  a  revolution  in  the  dairy  industry.  Prof.\\nSatish Dhawan developed mission management concepts\\nin  space  research.  These  are  but  a  few  examples  of\\nindividuals  who  have  not  only  articulated  but  also\\nimplemented their ideas, thus changing forever the face of\\nresearch and business organizations all over the world.\\n\\nflow.  Advancing \\n\\ntotality  and \\n\\nIn the IGMDP, I attempted to integrate the vision of Prof.\\nSarabhai and the mission of Prof. Dhawan by adapting the\\nhigh  technology  setting  of  Dr  Brahm  Prakash’s  space\\nresearch. I attempted to add the natural law of Latency in\\nfounding the Indian Guided Missile Programme in order to\\ncreate  a  completely  indigenous  variety  of  technology\\nmanagement. Let me use a metaphor to illuminate this.\\n\\nis \\n\\nThe  tree  of  technology  management  takes  root  only  if\\nthere \\nrenewal,\\nthe  self-actualization  of  needs, \\ninterdependence, and natural flow. The growth patterns are\\ncharacteristic  of  the  evolution  process,  which  means  that\\nthings move in a combination of slow change and sudden\\ntransformation;  each  transformation  causes  either  a  leap\\ninto  a  new,  more  complex  level  or  a  devastating  crash  to\\nsome earlier level; dominant models reach a certain peak\\nof  success  when  they  turn  troublesome;  and  the  rate  of\\nchange always accelerates.\\n\\nThe stem of the tree is the molecular structure in which\\nall actions are formative, all policies are normative, and all\\ndecisions  are  integrative.  The  branches  of  this  tree  are\\nresources,  assets,  operations,  and  products  which  are\\nnourished  by  the  stem  through  a  continuous  performance\\nevaluation and corrective update.\\n\\nThis tree of technology management, if carefully tended,\\nbears the fruits of an adaptive infrastructure: technological\\nempowerment of the institutions, the generation of technical\\nskills  among  people,  and  finally  self-reliance  of  the  nation\\nand improvement in the quality of life of its citizenry.\\n\\nWhen IGMDP was sanctioned in 1983, we did not have\\nan adequate technology base. A few pockets of expertise\\nwere  available,  but  we  lacked  the  authority  to  utilize  that\\nexpert  technology.  The  multi-project  environment  of  the\\nprogramme provided a challenge, for five advanced missile\\nsystems  had \\nto  be  simultaneously  developed.  This\\ndemanded  judicious  sharing  of  resources,  establishing\\npriorities, and ongoing induction of manpower. Eventually,\\nthe  IGMDP  had  78  partners,  including  36  technology\\n\\n\\x0cIn \\n\\nin \\n\\nthe  Government. \\n\\ncentres  and  41  production  centres  spread  over  public\\nsector undertakings, ordnance factories, private industries,\\nand  professional  societies,  hand-in  hand  with  a  well-knit\\nbureaucratic  structure \\nthe\\nmanagement  of  the  Programme,  as  much  as  in  the\\ntechnological inputs, we attempted to develop a model that\\nwas  appropriate,  even  tailor-made,  for  our  very  specific\\nneeds and capabilities. We borrowed ideas that had been\\ndeveloped elsewhere, but adapted them in the light of what\\nwe knew were our strengths and what we recognized as the\\nconstraints we would be compelled to work under. All in all,\\nthe  combination  of  appropriate  management  and  our\\ncooperative  endeavours  helped  to  unearth  the  talent  and\\npotential  that  lay  unused  in  our  research  laboratories,\\ngovernment institutions and private industries.\\n\\nThe  Technology  Management  philosophy  of  IGMDP  is\\nnot  exclusive  to  missile  development.  It  represents  the\\nnational urge to succeed and an awareness that the world\\nwill never again be directed by muscle or money power. In\\nfact,  both  these  powers  will  depend  on  technological\\nexcellence. Technology respects only technology. And, as I\\nsaid in the beginning, technology, unlike science, is a group\\nactivity. It does not grow only through individual intelligence,\\nbut  by  intelligences  interacting  and  ceaselessly  individual\\nintelligence, but by intelligences interacting and ceaselessly\\nstrong Indian family which also makes missile systems.\\n\\nThere  has  been  much  speculation  and  philosophizing\\nabout  the  life  and  times  of  our  scientists,  but  not  enough\\nexploration  in  determining  where  they  wanted  to  go  and\\nhow they reached there. In sharing with you the story of my\\nstruggle  to  become  a  person,  I  have  perhaps  given  you\\nsome insight into this journey. I hope it will help at least a\\nfew young people to stand up to the authoritarianism in our\\nsociety.  A \\nsocial\\nauthoritarianism  is  its  insidious  ability  to  addict  people  to\\nthe  endless  pursuit  of  external  rewards,  wealth,  prestige,\\nposition,  promotion,  approval  of  one’s  lifestyle  by  others,\\nceremonial honours, and status symbols of all kinds.\\n\\ncharacteristic \\n\\nfeature  of \\n\\nthis \\n\\nTo successfully pursue these goals, they have to learn\\nelaborate rules of etiquette and familiarize themselves with\\ncustoms, traditions, protocols and so on. The youth of today\\nmust  unlearn  this  self-defeating  way  of  life.  The  culture  of\\nworking only for material possessions and rewards must be\\ndiscarded.  When  I  see  wealthy,  powerful  and  learned\\npeople  struggling  to  be  at  peace  with  themselves,  I\\nremember  people  like  Ahmed  Jallaluddin  and  Iyadurai\\nSolomon.  How  happy \\nthey  were  with  virtually  no\\npossessions!\\n\\nOn the coast of Coromandel\\n\\nWhere the earthy shells blow,\\nIn the middle of the sands\\nLived some really rich souls.\\nOne cotton lungi and half a candle –\\nOne old jug without a handle\\nThese were all the worldly possessions\\nOf these kings in the middle of the sands.\\n\\nHow did they feel so secure without anything to fall back\\nupon?  I  believe  they  drew  sustenance  from  within.  They\\nrelied  more  on  the  inner  signals  and  less  on  the  external\\ncues that I have mentioned above. Are you aware of your\\ninner signals? Do you trust them? Have you taken control\\nover your life into your own hands? Take this from me, the\\nmore decisions you can make avoiding external pressures,\\nwhich  will  constantly  try  to  manipulate  you,  the  better  your\\nlife  will  be,  the  better  your  society  will  become.  Infact  the\\n\\n\\x0centire  nation  will  benefit  by  having  strong,  inwardlooking\\npeople as their leaders. A citizenry that thinks for itself, a\\ncountry  of  people  who  trust  themselves  as  individuals,\\nwould  be  virtually \\nto  manipulation  by  any\\nunscrupulous authority or vested interest.\\n\\nimmune \\n\\nYour  willingness  to  use  your  own  inner  resources  to\\ninvest in your life, especially your imagination, will bring you\\nsuccess. When you address a task from your own uniquely\\nindividual standpoint, you become a whole person.\\n\\nEveryone on this planet is sent forth by Him to cultivate\\nall the creative potential within us and live at peace with our\\nown  choices.  We  differ  in  the  way  we  make  our  choices\\nand evolve our destiny. Life is a difficult game. You can win\\nonly by retaining your birthright to be a person. And to retain\\nthis  right,  you  will  have  to  be  willing  to  take  the  social  or\\nexternal  risks  involved  in  ignoring  pressures  to  do  things\\nthe way others say they should be done. What will you call\\nSivasubramania  Iyer  inviting  me  to  have  lunch  in  his\\nkitchen?  Zohara,  my  sister,  mortgaging  her  gold  bangles\\nand  chains  to  get  me  into  engineering  college?  Prof.\\nSponder insisting that I should sit with him in the front row\\nfor the group photograph? Making a hovercraft in a motor-\\ngarage setup? Sudhakar’s courage? Dr Brahm Prakash’s\\nsupport?  Narayanan’s  management?  Venkataraman’s\\nvision?  Arunachalam’s  drive?  Each  is  an  example  of  a\\nstrong inner strength and initiative. As Pythagoras had said\\ntwenty-five  centuries  ago,  “Above  all  things,  reverence\\nyourself.”\\n\\nlarge  crosssection  of  people \\n\\nI am not a philosopher. I am only a man of technology. I\\nspent all my life learning rocketry. But as I have worked with\\na  very \\nin  different\\norganizations,  I  had  an  opportunity  to  understand  the\\nphenomenon  of  professional \\nits  bewildering\\ncomplexity. When I look back upon what I have narrated so\\nfar,  my  own  observations  and  conclusions  appear  as\\ndogmatic  utterances.  My  colleagues,  associates,  leaders;\\nthe  complex  science  of  rocketry;  the  important  issues  of\\ntechnology management; all seem to have been dealt with\\nin  a  perfunctory  manner.  The  despair  and  happiness,  the\\nachievements  and \\nin\\nfailures—differing  markedly \\ncontext, time, and space—all appear grouped together.\\n\\nthe \\n\\nlife \\n\\nin \\n\\nWhen you look down from an aircraft, people, houses,\\nrocks,  fields,  trees,  all  appear  as  one  homogeneous\\nlandscape, it is very difficult to distinguish one from another.\\nWhat you have just read is a similar bird’seye view of my\\nlife seen, as it were, from afar.\\n\\nMy worthiness is all my doubt –\\n\\nHis merit – all my fear –\\nContrasting which my quality\\nDoes however – appear.\\n\\nThis is the story of the period ending with the first Agni\\nlaunch—life  will  go  on.  This  great  country  will  make\\nenormous strides in all fields if we think like a united nation\\nof  900  million  people.  My  story—the  story  of  the  son  of\\nJainulabdeen,  who  lived  for  over  a  hundred  years  on\\nMosque Street in Rameswaram island and died there; the\\nstory of a lad who sold newspapers to help his brother; the\\nstory of a pupil reared by Sivasubramania Iyer and Iyadurai\\nSolomon;  the  story  of  a  student  taught  by  teachers  like\\nPandalai; the story of an engineer spotted by MGK Menon\\nand groomed by the legendary Prof. Sarabhai; the story of\\na  scientist  tested  by  failures  and  setbacks;  the  story  of  a\\nleader supported by a large team of brilliant and dedicated\\nprofessionals.  This  story  will  end  with  me,  for  I  have  no\\nbelongings  in  the  worldly  sense.  I  have  acquired  nothing,\\n\\n\\x0cbuilt nothing, possess nothing—no family, sons, daughters.\\n\\nI am a well in this great land\\n\\nLooking at its millions of boys and girls\\nTo draw from me\\nThe inexhaustible divinity\\nAnd spread His grace everywhere\\nAs does the water drawn from a well.\\n\\nI do not wish to set myself up as an example to others,\\nbut I believe that a few readers may draw inspiration and\\ncome  to  experience  that  ultimate  satisfaction  which  can\\nonly  be  found  in  the  life  of  the  spirit.  God’s  providence  is\\nyour inheritance. The bloodline of my greatgrandfather Avul,\\nmy grandfather Pakir, and my father Jainulabdeen may end\\nwith Abdul Kalam, but His grace will never cease, for it is\\nEternal.\\n* * *\\nWINGS OF FIRE ORIENTATION - 1\\n\\nthese \\n\\nearnestly hope and pray that the development resulting\\nfrom \\ntwo  plans—Self  Reliance  Mission  and\\nTechnology  Vision  –  2020—will  eventually  make  our\\ncountry  strong  and  prosperous  and  take  our  rightful  place\\namong the ranks of the “developed” nations.\\n***\\n\\n\\x0cEpilogue\\n\\nThis book is interwoven with my deep involvement with\\nIndia’s  first  Satellite  Launch  Vehicle  SLV-3  and  Agni\\nProgrammes,  an  involvement  which  eventually  led  to  my\\nparticipation in the recent important national event related\\nto  the  nuclear  tests  in  May,  1998.  I  have  had  the  great\\nopportunity  and  honour  of  working  with  three  scientific\\nestablishments—  Space,  Defence  Research  and  Atomic\\nEnergy. I found, while working in these establishments, that\\nthe best of human beings and the best of innovative minds\\nwere available in plenty. One feature common to all three\\nestablishments,  is  that  the  scientists  and  technologists\\nwere never afraid of failures during their missions. Failures\\ncontain  within  themselves  the  seeds  of  further  learning\\nwhich  can  lead  to  better  technology,  and  eventually,  to  a\\nhigh  level  of  success.  These  people  were  also  great\\ndreamers  and \\nin\\nspectacular  achievements.  I  feel  that  if  we  consider  the\\ncombined  technological  strength  of  all  these  scientific\\ninstitutions,  it  would  certainly  be  comparable  to  the  best\\nfound  anywhere  in  the  world.  Above  all,  I  have  had  the\\nopportunity  of  working  with  the  great  visionaries  of  the\\nnation, namely Prof. Vikram Sarabhai, Prof. Satish Dhawan\\nand  Dr  Brahm  Prakash,  each  of  whom  have  greatly\\nenriched my life.\\n\\nfinally  culminated \\n\\ntheir  dreams \\n\\nA  nation  needs  both  economic  prosperity  and  strong\\nsecurity  for  growth  and  development.  Our  Self  Reliance\\nMission  in  Defence  System  1995–  2005  will  provide  the\\nArmed Forces with a state-of-the-art competitive weapons\\nsystem.  The  Technology  Vision  –  2020  plan  will  put  into\\nplace certain schemes and plans for the economic growth\\nand prosperity of the nation. These two plans have evolved\\nout of the nation’s dreams. I\\n\\n\\x0c'"
